Home advantage helps WBA but their inconsistent form and Sheffield's hot streak suggests WBA win probability is closer to 40%, not 60%.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump establish a Gaza \"Board of Peace\" in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -81%\nExpected Value: 81% \u00d7 25 = Very high EV on NO\nReasoning: The news explicitly states the Board of Peace is \"expected to be announced in early 2026\" - not in 2025.
