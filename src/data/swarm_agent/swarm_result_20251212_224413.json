([wilx.com](https://www.wilx.com/2025/12/12/high-powered-offenses-clash-when-jared-goff-led-lions-visit-matthew-staffords-rams/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performances:**\n\n- **Detroit Lions:** The Lions are coming off a 44-30 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, a win that was marred by the season-ending Achilles injury to starting safety Brian Branch. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/report-lions-signing-veteran-db-damontae-kazee--flm-2025-12-08/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Los Angeles Rams:** The Rams rebounded from a loss to the Carolina Panthers by dominating the Arizona Cardinals 45-17. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, while rookie receiver Puka Nacua caught two touchdown passes.

([federalreserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a1.htm?utm_source=openai)) This decision was made despite some dissent within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Notably, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted against the cut, citing concerns over persistently high inflation and the lack of up-to-date economic data due to a recent government shutdown. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-goolsbee-says-dissent-was-favor-waiting-more-data-would-have-entailed-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai))\n\nLooking ahead, the FOMC is scheduled to meet on January 28\u201329, 2026. While it's too early to predict the committee's decision, current market expectations suggest a 21.8% chance of another rate cut at that meeting.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on the Fed making three consecutive rate cuts, as all models agree the 92.5% market price is vastly overconfident given internal dissent and inflation concerns. For the NBA over/under, most models see a significant edge (10%+) favoring the \"YES\" (Under) bet based on strong team trends and expert analysis. There is notable disagreement on the NFL game, with estimates for the Rams' true probability ranging widely from 25% to 82%, resulting in no clear trade recommendation.",

The Lions lost safety Brian Branch to injury, and Stafford/Rams just dominated Arizona 45-17. Home field advantage and Rams' better record suggest this is closer to a coin flip or slight Rams favor.

For all three cuts to happen, we'd need Jan AND Mar cuts with inflation concerns present.
