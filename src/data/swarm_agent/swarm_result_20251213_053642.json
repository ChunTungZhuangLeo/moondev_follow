His lead over other candidates is substantial, suggesting a high likelihood of winning the primary.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite earlier reports of a potential resignation, there has been no official confirmation or recent developments indicating Dan Bongino's departure from the Trump administration.
