Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Bulls vs. Hornets\nCurrent Market Price: 58.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $6,445.88 on Bulls\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/nba-chi-cha-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe Chicago Bulls and Charlotte Hornets are set to face off on Friday, December 12, 2025, in Charlotte. Both teams are aiming to overcome recent challenges: the Bulls are on a seven-game losing streak, while the Hornets have lost three of their last four games. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performances:**\n\n- **Chicago Bulls:** In their most recent game, the Bulls suffered a 123-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors, marking their worst offensive performance of the season. Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for improved team effort and attention to detail to break the losing streak. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets are dealing with multiple injuries, including key players LaMelo Ball, Tre Mann, Collin Sexton, and Moussa Diabate, all of whom \n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?\nCurrent Market Price: 40.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $970.72 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-kabuto-1st-edition-card-hit-100-by-december-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe value of first-edition Kabuto Pok\u00e9mon cards has experienced a significant surge due to the efforts of an anonymous collector known as \"Kabuto King.\" Since August 2025, Kabuto King has amassed 1,748 copies of this card, leading to a price increase from under $1 to over $28 per card. ([newsminimalist.com](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/collector-buys-every-first-edition-kabuto-pokemon-card-driving-up-prices-0badf591?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis surge has been accompanied by notable events, including a charity auction where a signed first-edition Kabuto card sold for $51,100, with proceeds benefiting St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-auction-autographed-card-154500572.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the current trajectory and the collector's ongoing acquisition efforts, it's plausible that the price of first-edition Kabuto cards could reach or exceed $100 by December 31, 2025. However, market dynamics can b\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not yet held its January 2026 meeting, so no official decision has been made regarding a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate decrease. However, recent developments provide insight into potential future actions:\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut**: On December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps, bringing it to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. This decision was accompanied by cautious language, indicating that further rate cuts are not guaranteed. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rates-decision?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Market Expectations**: Despite the Fed's cautious stance, financial markets anticipate additional rate cuts in 2026. Brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Barclays project a total of 50 bps in rate cuts across two actions in 2026, with potential cuts in March and June.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear >10% edge only for Market 2 (Kabuto card), with most AIs recommending a YES trade due to the collector-driven price surge. For Market 1 (Bulls vs. Hornets), opinions on the true probability vary widely, resulting in no strong trade agreement, while for Market 3 (Fed rates), most agree the market price at 81% is too high, favoring a NO position. Overall, the collective analysis suggests one actionable trade and cautions against the others due to insufficient edge or overvaluation.",

However, the Hornets are significantly injured with LaMelo Ball, Tre Mann, Collin Sexton, and Moussa Diabate all out. The Bulls should be favored against a depleted Hornets roster, but the edge is only 7%, below the 10% threshold required for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?\n**Your Probability: 25%**\n**Market Price: 40%**\n**Edge: -15%**\n**Expected Value: +15% \u00d7 (1/0.4 - 1) = +22.5% on NO**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** Current price is ~$28 after \"Kabuto King\" manipulation drove it from <$1. Reaching $100 requires a 257% increase in 19 days. While the $51,100 charity auction shows hype exists, that was a unique signed card.
