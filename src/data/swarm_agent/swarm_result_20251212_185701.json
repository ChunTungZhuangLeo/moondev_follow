      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: Despite a recent substantial bet on Team Nemesis, their poor recent performance (losing all of their last 5 matches) and lower global ranking compared to Nigma Galaxy suggest they are the underdogs in this match. Nigma Galaxy's slightly better form and higher ranking make them more likely to win Game 1.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Both Angers SCO and FC Nantes have an identical record of scoring over 1.5 goals in 64% of their matches this season. Additionally, despite Angers' strong defense, the likelihood of both teams' scoring trends suggests that the match is likely to exceed the 1.5 goals threshold.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The overwhelming majority of participants (91%) are betting against Lighter's FDV surpassing $6 billion one day post-launch, indicating strong market skepticism. Without any specific news suggesting exceptional demand or market conditions to contradict this sentiment, it is reasonable to predict \"No\" for this market.",

Nigma Galaxy appears to be the stronger team.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both teams have scored over 1.5 goals in 64% of their matches this season, and while Angers has kept clean sheets recently, Nantes has conceded in 86% of their matches. The statistical likelihood favors at least 2 goals being scored in this match.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: With 91% of participants betting No and only 9% betting Yes, the market strongly reflects skepticism that Lighter can achieve a $6B FDV within 24 hours of launch. Reaching such a high valuation immediately post-launch is extremely rare for any crypto project without exceptional circumstances.",

However, with Nigma Galaxy ranked higher globally and Team Nemesis at #73, the recent $1,000 bet on Nemesis seems contrarian. The data quality issues make this unreliable.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both teams have scored over 1.5 goals in 64% of their matches this season, and Nantes has conceded in 86% of matches, suggesting defensive vulnerabilities. The statistical trends strongly favor over 1.5 total goals in this matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The market shows 91% betting \"No\" on $6B FDV, and the recent $974 trade was on No. Achieving a $6B FDV within 24 hours of launch would require exceptional hype and demand that most new token launches don't achieve, making the skepticism well-founded.",
