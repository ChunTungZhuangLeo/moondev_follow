The prediction market \"MetaMask FDV above $3B one day after launch?\" on Polymarket is currently trading at 7.3%, suggesting that traders assign a low probability to this event occurring. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/paradex-fdv-above-3b-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai))\n\nMetaMask has previously introduced features such as validator staking services for Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ether directly through the MetaMask Portfolio interface. ([platinumcryptoacademy.com](https://www.platinumcryptoacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CW_EDITION_320th_1.pdf?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, in September 2023, MetaMask added options for users to cash out digital assets to bank or PayPal accounts directly from their browser-based wallet.

In January 2024, unsealed court documents from a 2015 defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell revealed that Epstein had communicated with Hawking. Notably, an email from Epstein to Maxwell discussed a reward for individuals who could disprove allegations that Hawking participated in an \"underage orgy.\" ([mediaite.com](https://www.mediaite.com/uk/jeffrey-epstein-offered-reward-to-disprove-stephen-hawking-orgy-allegations/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that these documents do not accuse Hawking of any wrongdoing. The references to him are limited to these communications, and no evidence has emerged linking him to Epstein's illicit activities. Additionally, some claims circulating online about Hawking's involvement with Epstein are based on fabricated images and have been debunked by fact-checking organizations.

In their most recent matchup on December 8, they were defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies with a score of 119-96.

Regarding the NBA spread, most models favor the Pelicans or advise no trade, citing the Trail Blazers' injuries and poor form as key factors.",

The documents mainly refer to emails and debunked allegations, reinforcing the position that he is unlikely to be named.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Trail Blazers have been struggling with recent losses and significant injuries to key players like Jrue Holiday and Matisse Thybulle.
