Recent developments provide insight into the evolving political landscape:\n\n**Election Outlook and Polls**\n\nA recent N\u00e9z\u0151pont Institute survey indicates that 50% of Hungarians believe Orb\u00e1n is the most likely winner of the 2026 election, with his main challenger, P\u00e9ter Magyar of the Tisza Party, at 32%. This shift follows Orb\u00e1n's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which appears to have bolstered his domestic support.

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: Despite some challenges indicated by the European election results, Viktor Orb\u00e1n remains a strong contender for the 2026 parliamentary elections, with a survey showing 50% of Hungarians believe he is the most likely winner. His recent meetings and political maneuvers have bolstered his domestic support, making it likely he will continue as Prime Minister.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The Dallas Mavericks are severely impacted by key injuries, including Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, which weakens their performance potential significantly. Given these setbacks, it is unlikely the Mavericks will cover a spread of -8.5 against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Hanwha Life Esports recently defeated Dplus KIA in a previous series, showcasing strong performances from key players like Aiming and Viper. This recent success against the same opponent suggests they are well-positioned to win Game 3.",

Fidesz maintains institutional advantages that make Orb\u00e1n's continuation as PM the probable outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: With Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Kyrie Irving, and Dereck Lively II all out with significant injuries, the Mavericks covering an 8.5-point spread against the Nets is highly unlikely. This is a severely depleted Dallas team that will struggle to win convincingly.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This appears to be a live esports match with recent trading activity suggesting Game 3 is in progress or imminent. Historical data shows HLE won Game 3 in their previous series, but individual game outcomes are highly volatile and I lack sufficient real-time information to make a confident prediction.",

The political landscape is too fluid with significant time remaining to make a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO (bet on Nets to cover)\nReasoning: The Mavericks are missing their three most critical players - Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (calf strain), Kyrie Irving (bulging disc), and Dereck Lively II (season-ending surgery). Without their two superstars and starting center, covering an 8.5-point spread against any NBA team is extremely difficult.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The provided context references a match from May 24, 2025 (which Hanwha won 2-1), but this appears to be about a current/upcoming Game 3.
