Jets decimated by QB injuries (Taylor groin, Fields knee, rookie backup). However, 13.5 points is a large spread in NFL - covers happen ~50% of time historically.

Barcelona should be heavy favorites to win this home match. Market has massively mispriced this - 93% for Osasuna to WIN is absurd. Strong NO bet on Osasuna winning.",

      "response": "Based on the news context provided, here are my analyses:\n\n**MARKET 1: Spread: Jaguars (-13.5)**\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: -10%\nExpected Value: -10% \u00d7 1.92 = -19.2%\nReasoning: While the Jaguars are on a 4-game winning streak with Lawrence playing well, 13.5 points is a massive spread. The Jets' QB situation is dire with Taylor and Fields injured, but NFL games rarely see 14+ point margins even with backup QBs. The Jaguars aren't historically dominant enough to cover this spread reliably, and divisional/non-divisional games tend to be closer than expected.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Graham Platner be the Democratic nominee for Senate in Maine?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 60%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: -5% \u00d7 2.5 = -12.5%\nReasoning: Platner has strong progressive endorsements (Bernie Sanders, PCCC, UAW), but he's running against sitting Governor Janet Mills, who typically holds significant institutional advantages in primaries. The race appears competitive but Mills as an incumbent governor would normally be favored. The 60% market price seems slightly high for Platner but not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will CA Osasuna win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 93%\nEdge: -85%\nExpected Value: This appears to be a market error - 93% for Osasuna to WIN against league-leading Barcelona at Camp Nou is absurd\nReasoning: This market price must be inverted or erroneous. Barcelona leads LaLiga with 40 points, has won 6 straight, and is playing at home. Osasuna winning at Camp Nou against this Barcelona side should be around 8-12% probability, not 93%. Strong NO recommendation if the market truly prices Osasuna winning at 93%.",
