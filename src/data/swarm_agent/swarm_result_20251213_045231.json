The market shows 90% for Utah -1.5 spread.\n\nWait - the news context is about the Utah Jazz (NBA), not Utah Hockey Club (NHL). This is a mismatch. The NHL Utah team is new and different from the Jazz. Without proper NHL context for this specific game, I need to be cautious. A 90% probability for covering -1.5 in hockey is extremely high - NHL games are typically close.\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 90%\nEdge: -35%\nExpected Value: 35% \u00d7 1.11 = +38.9% on NO\nReasoning: NHL games are notoriously tight; a -1.5 spread at 90% is grossly overpriced. Even strong favorites rarely cover -1.5 at 90% implied probability in hockey where 1-goal games are common.\n\n---\n\n**Market 2: Boise State vs. Washington**\nMarket shows 24% for Boise State to win the LA Bowl. Boise State is 9-4 (Mountain West champs), Washington is 8-4 (Big Ten). Both are solid teams, but Boise State has conference championship momentum and a slightly better record.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 24%\nEdge: +21%\nExpected Value: 21% \u00d7 3.17 = +66.6%\nReasoning: Boise State as Mountain West champions with a 9-4 record facing an 8-4 Washington team should be much closer to a coin flip. The 24% drastically undervalues Boise State's chances in this matchup.\n\n---\n\n**Market 3: Flames vs. Kings**\nMarket shows 38% for Flames to win. Calgary is on a 3-game winning streak with strong offensive performance. Kings are at home but coming off a loss.

Utah Hockey Club is a solid home team but -1.5 spread at 90% is slightly overpriced. The recent $756 bet suggests sharp money, but not enough edge to justify a position either way.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge insufficient (<10%)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 24%\nEdge: +18% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (18% \u00d7 4.17x payout = 75% EV)\nReasoning: Boise State is the Mountain West champion (9-4) coming off a conference title win, while Washington (8-4) struggled in Big Ten play.
