The operation employs a hybrid fleet of vessels, including unmanned surface vehicles, to detect and disrupt alleged drug trafficking networks. By late November, the U.S. had deployed nearly 12,000 personnel to the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, conducting airstrikes on vessels suspected of being operated by narcoterrorist groups such as Venezuela's Tren de Aragua and Colombia's National Liberation Army. These operations have resulted in at least 87 fatalities.

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: The Jacksonville Jaguars are currently on a strong run with four consecutive wins, and their quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, is performing exceptionally well. In contrast, the New York Jets are struggling, having lost their last three games and dealing with a rookie quarterback. Given these circumstances, the Jaguars covering a 13.5-point spread seems likely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both teams have shown the ability to score, with the 76ers recently putting up 116 points and the Pacers improving offensively. However, with recent trades betting on the \"Under,\" there could be uncertainties regarding the teams' performances. The information does not provide a clear edge on either side of the 229.5 total points line.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The U.S. has already conducted significant anti-cartel operations on foreign soil under Operation Southern Spear, including airstrikes and military deployments. Given the intensity and scale of these operations, it is unlikely that a new, distinct anti-cartel strike would occur before December 31.",

      "response": "Based on the recent news and context provided, here are my predictions:\n\nMARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the Jaguars are hot with a 4-game win streak and the Jets are struggling at 3-10 with quarterback issues, 13.5 points is a large spread. NFL games can be unpredictable, and covering nearly two touchdowns even against a weak opponent carries significant risk.\n\nMARKET 2: Under\nReasoning: The 76ers' recent 116-101 game against the Bucks (217 total) stayed under, and with both teams potentially managing injuries and the 76ers relying heavily on bench production, defensive intensity could keep this game under 229.5 points.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The news clearly indicates Operation Southern Spear has already been conducted with U.S. military airstrikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific resulting in 87 fatalities - this definitively qualifies as an anti-cartel strike/operation on foreign soil before December 31, making YES the clear answer.",

Without trustworthy current information about team performance, injuries, and actual game circumstances, I cannot make a confident prediction on this 13.5-point spread.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Similar to Market 1, the context references games in December 2025 (future dates), making the data unreliable. Additionally, without current injury reports, lineup confirmations, and recent actual performance data, predicting whether this game goes over/under 229.5 points would be speculative.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The context describes Operation Southern Spear already ongoing since August 2025 with 12,000 personnel deployed and airstrikes conducted resulting in 87 fatalities. This clearly constitutes anti-cartel strikes/operations on foreign soil, meaning the market condition has already been met before the December 31 deadline.",
