Their last encounter totaled 163 points, and given both teams' scoring trends, it seems unlikely they will exceed 166.5 points combined.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: MOUZ has demonstrated consistent dominance over FaZe in recent matchups, including a decisive 2-0 victory in their latest encounter. With a strong head-to-head record in the past tournaments, betting on MOUZ to win seems favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: 9INE has struggled recently with a low win rate, but they have a strong map preference which could give them an advantage. SPARTA's recent performance details are not provided, making it difficult to assess their current form relative to 9INE. Lacking comprehensive information, a NO_TRADE position is prudent.",
