  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 3 as the clearest opportunity, with all analysts agreeing the 92.8% price for a Braunschweig win is severely overvalued given their poor form, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Markets 1 and 2, opinions are mixed but converge on \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient edge, as the market prices are generally seen as reasonably accurate given the available context. Overall, the collective analysis suggests only Market 3 presents a strong, actionable discrepancy.",

Covering -1.5 (winning by 2+) against Chicago is difficult for a struggling team, but the market already reflects skepticism at 33%. Edge insufficient.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (72% - 77.8%)\nExpected Value: Not sufficient for trade\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs Pipsqueak+4 at #25, but both teams have identical 2-5 recent records. The ranking gap justifies Heroic as favorites, but 77.8% seems slightly high given both teams' mediocre recent form. Edge insufficient for a trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8% (35% - 92.8%)\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side (~8x potential return)\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. Braunschweig has won only 1 of their last 5 matches and is playing AWAY at Dresden. Dresden has better recent form (2 wins vs 1). A 92.8% win probability for an away team with poor form against a home team is wildly incorrect - this looks like a market error or manipulation. Strong NO bet.",

However, spread betting on NHL is volatile and the edge isn't sufficient to recommend NO.\n\nDecision: **NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 5%, below the 10% threshold required for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Heroic ranked #9 vs Pipsqueak+4 ranked #25 with 97% community prediction for Heroic. However, both teams have identical 2-3 recent form. Game 1 in Bo3 series can be volatile - underdogs often take first games before favorites adjust. Market slightly overvalues Heroic for single game.\n\nDecision: **NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 5.8%, below the 10% threshold.

Braunschweig is the AWAY team at Dresden's Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion with poor form (1W-1D-3L in last 5). Dresden has home advantage with 2W-1D-2L recent form. Head-to-head shows competitive history. A 92.8% probability for an away underdog is absurd - this should be closer to 30-35%.\n\nDecision: **NO** - Massive 57.8% edge. The market has likely confused home/away or misread the fixture. Eintracht Braunschweig winning away at Dresden should be around 30-40% probability, not 93%. This is a strong NO bet with exceptional value.",
