Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for improved team effort and attention to detail to break the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets have lost three of their last four games, including a 115-106 defeat to the Denver Nuggets.

However, recent developments provide context for potential future rate adjustments:\n\n**Recent Federal Reserve Actions and Projections:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve reduced its key interest rate by 25 bps to 3.6%, marking its third consecutive rate cut. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/442de589de9b99bb811f76e402b00948?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2026 Rate Projections:** The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) latest projections indicate a federal funds rate averaging 3.4% by the end of 2026, suggesting a potential 25 bps rate cut in 2026.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts **NO** for a Fed rate cut in January 2026, citing the recent December cut and projections for gradual easing. For the Kabuto card, opinions are split between **YES** (momentum) and **NO** (unsustainable), indicating high volatility and risk. Regarding the Bulls vs. Hornets game, most models either recommend **NO_TRADE** due to unpredictable team struggles or cannot predict due to the market's ambiguous title.",

The Bulls are on a seven-game losing streak, while the Hornets have lost three of their last four games with key players injured. This unpredictability suggests avoiding a bet.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The significant increase in the value of the Kabuto 1st Edition card, driven by the collector \"Kabuto King,\" and recent auction events indicate a strong upward trend. With the card's price already reaching over $37 and significant market interest, it seems plausible it could hit $100 by December 31.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The Federal Reserve has already implemented a series of rate cuts, including a recent 25 bps cut in December 2025. However, the projections indicate modest further cuts over the next year, suggesting that an additional cut in January 2026 is less likely, aligning with the recent trading sentiment.",

Despite Charlotte's injury concerns, home court advantage and Chicago's worse recent form favor the Hornets.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The Kabuto card has risen dramatically from under $1 to $37+ due to \"Kabuto King's\" buying spree, but reaching $100 by December 31 requires nearly tripling in ~19 days. This is highly speculative and depends entirely on one collector's continued buying behavior.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Fed just cut rates in December 2025 and projections show only 50 bps of cuts total through 2026-2027. With inflation concerns and the recent December cut, the Fed is likely to pause in January to assess economic conditions before any further cuts.",

The market manipulation appears unsustainable and the $51,100 auction was a special signed charity item, not reflective of regular card values.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Fed just cut rates on December 10, 2025, and their own projections show only 25 bps total cuts expected for all of 2026 (to 3.4% by year-end). Market expectations indicate a pause in January with potential cuts later in 2026, making an immediate January cut highly unlikely.",
