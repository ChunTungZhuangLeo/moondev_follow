Given Southampton's current performance and momentum, they are well-positioned to win this match.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Natus Vincere (NAVI) has already been eliminated from the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 after losing to FURIA in the playoffs. Since they are no longer in the competition, it is impossible for them to win the tournament.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Phantom's recent revenue achievements and successful collaborations, the market assigns only a 5% chance of hitting $300k in daily builder revenue. The current revenue patterns and projections do not support reaching this daily target within the year 2025, making it unlikely to be achieved.",
