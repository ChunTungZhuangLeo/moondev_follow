Their home advantage at Stadion HNK Rijeka further supports the likelihood of a win.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Several CEO appointments have been announced recently, indicating active leadership changes across major companies. This trend suggests that it is likely a CEO will be announced in 2025, contrary to the market prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: FURIA's exceptional performance at the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, including decisive victories over strong teams like Imperial and G2 Esports, positions them as strong contenders to win the tournament.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: While Rijeka has better recent form, the large recent trade on \"No\" and the lack of head-to-head history introduce significant uncertainty, making the \"No\" side a higher-risk but potentially mispriced opportunity given the market's reaction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The news context shows multiple major CEO appointments announced in December 2025, directly contradicting the premise that \"no CEO will be announced in 2025.\"\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although FURIA is performing strongly and has advanced to the playoffs, they face a top opponent in Team Spirit, and the outcome of a single esports tournament is highly volatile, so the risk outweighs the value.",

      "response": "Based on the recent news and context provided, here are my predictions:\n\nMARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: HNK Rijeka has strong recent form (3 wins, 2 draws in last 5 matches) with excellent goal-scoring (2.6 goals/game) and defensive record (0.6 conceded/game), playing at home against NK Celje who have a weaker recent record. Home advantage and superior form favor Rijeka.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The market question is ambiguous - it appears to be asking about a specific company's CEO (likely X/Twitter based on the event link) but the news context shows general CEO announcements across various companies. Without clarity on which company this refers to, I cannot make an informed prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: FURIA has shown dominant form at the tournament with a flawless 3-0 record in Stage 3, including impressive wins over Imperial (13-5) and G2 (2-0). Their players are performing at high levels (molodoy with 1.71 rating), and they've established themselves as strong championship contenders heading into playoffs.",
