  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1 is severely mispriced, with all AIs finding a massive negative edge against the \"Yes\" position due to clear Fed guidance for rate cuts, though one model advises caution despite the apparent opportunity. For Market 2, estimates are split between a close \"No Trade\" and a \"Yes\" with a positive edge, indicating moderate disagreement on the match outcome's value. Regarding Market 3, the available responses concur on a negative edge, suggesting the market price overestimates the token's chance of reaching the target.",

All context points to rate *cuts* being projected, with a median Fed forecast of 3.4% for end-2026 (down from current 3.5%-3.75%). The probability of a *hike* is therefore very low, but the market price of 90% for YES is so extreme it suggests potential market misinterpretation of the question.
