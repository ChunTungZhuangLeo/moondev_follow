In its December 10 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%, marking its third consecutive rate cut. The FOMC's projections suggest only one additional 25 basis point cut in 2026, bringing the rate to 3.4% by year-end.

Goldman Sachs forecasts that the Fed will pause its rate cuts in January 2026, followed by reductions in March and June, totaling 50 basis points for the year.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has signaled that the federal funds rate may decline to 3.4% by the end of 2026, suggesting a single 25-basis-point reduction. ([fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/fed-projects-only-50-bps-of-additional-rate-cuts-between-2026-and-2027-lifts-gdp-forecasts-202512101951//?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis conservative stance is supported by the Fed's recent actions and projections. In its December 2025 meeting, the FOMC lowered the benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, marking the third consecutive rate cut. However, the committee's projections indicate only one additional rate cut in 2026, with rates expected to average 3.4% by the end of that year.

The sale will commence on December 15, 2025, through the Sonar platform, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) cap of $1 billion, aligning with the valuation from their previous Series A funding round led by a16z. ([kucoin.com](https://www.kucoin.com/news/insight/USDC/693925ec939ab60007a0f641?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe token sale will utilize an English auction format, starting with a floor price of $0.0001 per token and capping at $0.1 per token. Participants can bid using USDC or USDT on the Ethereum network, with a minimum bid of $100. Testnet users are eligible for priority allocation, purchase multipliers, and GPU workstation rewards.

Despite some financial institutions forecasting more aggressive cuts, the Fed's current stance leans towards just one cut, making two cuts unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: With a $1 billion FDV and the English auction structure, it's uncertain if the sale will attract over $200M in commitments. The recent trade on \"No\" reflects skepticism about reaching this high threshold, which seems reasonable given the sale's structure and market conditions.",
