The game is expected to be played in extremely cold conditions, with a forecasted high of 14\u00b0F and wind chills potentially reaching -20\u00b0F.

In his recent performance against the Tennessee Titans, Sanders threw for 364 yards, three touchdowns, and added a rushing touchdown, despite the team's 31-29 loss.

Consequently, prediction markets on platforms like Polymarket have not yet been established for this event. For instance, a market titled \"Fogo FDV above $2B one day after launch?\" is listed on Polymarket, but it currently has no trading volume or active positions, indicating that the event has not occurred or is not yet being actively traded. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/fogo-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the absence of specific information about Fogo's token launch, it's challenging to provide a concise summary of recent news, official announcements, expert opinions, or relevant statistics that would inform predictions about its FDV. For context, other prediction markets have been established for different tokens, such as the \"Sentient FDV above $1B one day after launch?\" market, which is currently tr...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Khamenei out as Supreme Leader of Iran by June 30?\nRecent trade: $1,003.99 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/khamenei-out-as-supreme-leader-of-iran-by-june-30-747\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no official announcement regarding the removal of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as Supreme Leader of Iran by June 30, 2026. However, several developments and analyses provide context to this speculation:\n\n**Health Concerns and Leadership Challenges:**\nReports indicate that Khamenei, now 86, has faced significant health issues, including advanced cognitive impairment and periods of seclusion. These health challenges have reportedly led to decision-making paralysis and increased factional infighting within Iran's leadership. ([stimson.org](https://www.stimson.org/2025/khameneis-eclipse-absolute-rule-crumbles-into-paralysis-and-infighting-in-iran/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Succession Planning:**\nIn response to escalating tensions, particularly with Israel, Khamenei has reportedly initiated emergency succession measures. He has relocated to a secure bunker, suspended digital communications, and communicated with senior commanders through a trusted aide. Additionally...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly predicts the Bears will win (Market 1: NO) and that Khamenei will not be removed by the deadline (Market 3: NO). For the Fogo token market (Market 2), most models advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to a complete lack of information, though one dissents with a \"NO\" prediction on the valuation's likelihood. Overall, predictions align where sports and political contexts are clear, but diverge to caution where data is absent.",

Despite Browns' rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders showing promise, the Bears are the stronger team overall.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: There is no available information on Fogo's token launch or its FDV, leading to a lack of context for making an informed decision. Without specific insights into the token's valuation or market sentiment, it's prudent to refrain from trading.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Khamenei's advanced age and reported health issues, there is no official announcement or credible indication that he will be removed as Supreme Leader by June 30, 2026. Historical precedence and the nature of Iran's political system suggest that such a transition would be unlikely without substantial, visible developments.",

The recent $1,000 trade on Bears aligns with the clear favorite status.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: There's no publicly available information about Fogo's token launch date or details, and achieving a $2B FDV immediately after launch is extremely rare for new tokens without major hype or backing. The lack of market activity suggests high uncertainty, but the $2B threshold is ambitious.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite health concerns and succession planning discussions, there's no indication Khamenei will be removed by June 30, 2026. Supreme Leaders in Iran historically serve until death, and even with reported health issues, the regime has strong incentives to maintain stability and continuity.",
