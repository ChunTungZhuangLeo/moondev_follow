  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's \"Yes\" price is overvalued, with all models estimating a true probability far below 96.8%, favoring a \"No\" trade. For Market 3, all analysts agree a US strike is highly improbable, creating a unanimous \"No\" recommendation against the market's 97.2% \"Yes\" price. The only significant disagreement is on Market 2, where analysts are split between \"Yes\" and \"No Trade,\" indicating a lack of clear edge.",
