  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1's \"YES\" is overvalued due to Stranger Things' steep viewership drop, but the edge is too small for a recommended trade. For Market 2, opinions are split between a \"YES\" bet (citing home advantage and head-to-head record) and a \"NO\" or \"NO_TRADE\" (citing recent poor form), indicating high uncertainty. There is notable disagreement on Market 3, with assessments of Crvena Zvezda's probability ranging from 60% to 90%, making any clear consensus trade recommendation impossible.",

By December 16 (week 3-4), further decline is likely as typical for streaming shows. However, it may still maintain #1 position due to strong initial momentum.

Despite recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg, their overall form and home advantage against a weaker opponent makes 75% probability reasonable.

This creates uncertainty. However, Partizan's poor 5-9 EuroLeague record and the announcement timing (after this game) suggests management instability. Market overvalues Crvena Zvezda - while they're favored, 74% is too high given derby volatility.",
