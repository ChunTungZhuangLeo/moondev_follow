  "consensus_summary": "Consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, recommending a \"NO\" trade due to the high market probability versus the low likelihood of actual establishment within 2025. For Market 3, most models see value in Barcelona, with a notable edge above the 10% threshold. Opinions on Market 1 are split between a \"NO\" trade and no trade, reflecting disagreement on whether Sheffield United's form sufficiently outweighs West Brom's home advantage.",

WBA's mixed form (2-1-2 in last 5) suggests roughly even odds. Market price of 60% is fairly accurate given the home advantage premium, but Sheffield's form makes this closer to 50-50.
