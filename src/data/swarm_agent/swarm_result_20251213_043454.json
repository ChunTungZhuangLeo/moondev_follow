Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet count between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been actively tracking and forecasting his Twitter activity during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been placing bets on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market is divided into various tweet count ranges, with the 280-299 tweets range being one of the options. As of the latest data, the probability of Musk posting between 280 and 299 tweets during this period is approximately 5%, with a \"No\" price of 95%. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis suggests that the majority of market participants believe Musk will post fewer than 280 tweets between December 9 and December 16, 2025.

([bo3.gg](https://bo3.gg/news/spirit-knock-falcons-out-of-the-starladder-budapest-major-2025-playoffs?utm_source=openai)) In this match, Ivan \"zweih\" Gogin delivered standout performances, securing an ace on each map, which significantly influenced the outcome.\n\nThroughout Stage 3 of the tournament, Team Spirit demonstrated exceptional form, completing a flawless run with three wins from three matches. This performance not only secured their spot in the semifinals but also made them the most popular team during this stage, averaging over 560,000 viewers per match.

This means that if the combined goals are 3 or more, the \"Over\" bet wins; if there are 2 or fewer goals, the \"Under\" bet wins.\n\n**Recent Trends and Statistics:**\n\n- **Major League Soccer (MLS):** Out of 538 games played this season, 315 matches (58.6%) had over 2.5 goals.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a severe data discrepancy in Market 1, with all models finding the 85.2% price implausible versus a ~5-10% true probability, though they disagree on whether to trade \"NO\" or avoid it. For Market 2, all models agree on a \"YES\" bet with a significant positive edge, estimating Team Spirit's true win probability between 45-50% against a 29% market price. Regarding Market 3, the models generally find insufficient edge or specific match data to recommend a trade.",

The 85.2% YES price appears to be an error or outdated data - this should be trading around 5-10% YES. However, without current tweet count data (we're on Dec 13, day 5 of 8), I cannot confidently estimate the true probability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Data inconsistency suggests potential display error or I'm misunderstanding the market structure.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +55.2% (16% edge \u00d7 3.45x payout)\nReasoning: Team Spirit just demolished Falcons 2-0 in semifinals with dominant performances, completed a flawless Stage 3 run, and are the tournament's most popular team with exceptional viewership. They're clearly in peak form and undervalued at 29% - should be closer to 40-50% given their momentum and semifinal position.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge based on recent dominant performance and tournament positioning.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +4.0% (insufficient edge)\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match between Team Spirit and Vitality. Without specific team statistics, recent form, or map pool data for this particular matchup, the 50/50 market price seems reasonable for a best-of-3 series over/under. The slight lean toward \"over\" reflects competitive matches tend to go longer.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge too small (<10% threshold), insufficient match-specific data to justify position.",

      "response": "Looking at each market:\n\n**MARKET 1: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?**\n\nThe web search context reveals a critical discrepancy - it mentions the \"No\" price is 95% on Polymarket for this specific range, meaning YES should be around 5%, not 85.2%. This appears to be a data error in the market price shown. Posting exactly 280-299 tweets in a week is a very narrow 20-tweet window. Even for a prolific tweeter like Musk, hitting this exact range has low probability. The 5% figure from the search context makes much more sense.\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 85.2%\nEdge: -77.2%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The market price appears severely mispriced or there's a data error. A 20-tweet window out of potentially 200-400+ weekly tweets should have ~5-10% probability, not 85%. Strong NO bet.\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nTeam Spirit is in the semifinals after a flawless Stage 3 run (3-0), showing dominant form. They're the most popular team with strong performances. With 4 teams remaining in semifinals, base probability would be 25%. Their exceptional recent form and momentum suggests slightly higher odds.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 32%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Team Spirit's strong form justifies slightly higher than 29%, but with 2 more matches needed to win and strong competition remaining, edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match)**\n\nThis is a CS2 esports match (Team Spirit vs Vitality based on URL), not soccer. In CS2, matches are typically Best-of-3, meaning 2-3 maps played. \"Over 2.5\" means the match goes to 3 maps (a 2-1 scoreline). Between evenly matched top teams, 3-map series occur roughly 50-60% of the time.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: For two competitive CS2 teams, roughly half of Bo3 matches go the distance. 50% is a fair price with minimal edge available.",
