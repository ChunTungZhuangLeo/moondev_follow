      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The recent performances of both teams show strong offensive capabilities, with the Nets scoring 119 points in their latest game and the Mavericks having a rookie scoring sensation. However, the recent large bet on the Under suggests there might be factors not visible in the limited available data. Without clear indications from the context, taking a position is risky.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Team Yandex has shown strong recent performance with a 60% win rate and a decisive victory over Virtus.pro. They are ranked #8 globally, while there is less detailed information about Amaru Gaming's recent performance and ranking. This context suggests a higher probability of Team Yandex winning Game 2.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The combined scoring average of the Jazz and Grizzlies is 231.2, which is significantly below the O/U line of 240.5. This suggests a good probability that the total score will be under 240.5, especially considering the current trend and recent large bet on the Under.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: Under\nReasoning: The recent $1,640 trade on Under aligns with typical Nets-Mavericks game patterns. While both teams have been playing well recently, the 221.5 line is moderate and Brooklyn's defensive presence with Claxton suggests this could stay under.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Team Yandex (ranked #8 globally) has a 60% win rate in recent matches including a 2-0 sweep of Virtus.pro, while Amaru Gaming shows only 50% in limited matches. The significant skill gap and recent form favor Team Yandex to take Game 2.\n\nMARKET 3: Under\nReasoning: The combined scoring average of both teams (approximately 231.2 points) is notably below the 240.5 O/U line. Recent $1,045 trade on Under reflects this statistical edge, making Under the value play here.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the Nets' recent game total was 220 (just under 221.5), the news highlights strong offensive performances from both teams' key players, making a definitive lean difficult without more comprehensive scoring trends or head-to-head data.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Team Yandex is ranked #8 globally and has a stronger recent win rate (60% vs Amaru's 50% in fewer games), indicating they are the favored team, and the outcome for Game 2 is not yet available.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The combined recent scoring average of the Grizzlies (113.6 PPG) and Jazz (117.6 PPG) is 231.2 points, which is significantly below the O/U line of 240.5, suggesting the game is likely to go under.",

Without clear injury reports or reliable scoring trends, this is too uncertain to bet.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The match was scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM and the context is from 3:40 PM, meaning Game 2 may already be in progress or completed. Betting on a potentially concluded match carries significant information asymmetry risk.\n\nMARKET 3: UNDER\nReasoning: Combined recent scoring averages of both teams (113.6 + 117.6 = 231.2) fall significantly below the 240.5 O/U line, providing an 9.3 point cushion. Recent market action also favors Under, and historical data supports this position.",
