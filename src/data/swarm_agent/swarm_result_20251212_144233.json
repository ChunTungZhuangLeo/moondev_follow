In November 2025, President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, mandating the Department of Justice to publicly release all unclassified files related to Epstein by December 19, 2025. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/20/trump-epstein-files-bill-signed?utm_source=openai))\n\nEarlier, in February 2025, the Department of Justice released the first phase of Epstein's documents, which included a contact list featuring high-profile individuals such as Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Alec Baldwin, and Ivanka Trump. However, these names were previously known, and none have been implicated in Epstein's illegal activities.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both OpTic Texas and Miami Heretics have shown strong recent performances, making it difficult to confidently predict a winner. The recent trade volume favoring Miami Heretics suggests some market sentiment, but the lack of clear dominance by either team suggests a neutral stance is prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The Grizzlies have been performing well, winning seven of their last nine games, while the Jazz have been struggling with a 3-7 record over their last ten games. Despite the injury to Zach Edey, the Grizzlies' recent form and the Jazz's poor record against the spread support a bet on the Grizzlies covering the -7.5 spread.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Michael Jackson's name has already appeared in previous Epstein-related documents as part of a contact list, and there is no indication that new incriminating information will emerge in the upcoming release. The recent trade favoring \"No\" aligns with the lack of new allegations or evidence suggesting his involvement in Epstein's illegal activities.",

Without clear pricing information and given esports volatility, this is too risky.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Memphis has won 7 of their last 9 games and is playing at home, while Utah is 3-7 in their last 10 with poor ATS performance. Despite Edey's injury, the Grizzlies should cover 7.5 against a struggling Jazz team.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Michael Jackson's name already appeared in Epstein's contact list released in February 2025, but this market likely asks about new revelations. Being in a contact list doesn't constitute being \"named\" in incriminating files, and there's no evidence suggesting Jackson will be implicated in any wrongdoing in upcoming releases.",

Despite Zach Edey's injury, the Grizzlies' recent momentum and home court advantage make covering the 7.5-point spread favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Michael Jackson's name was already included in the February 2025 DOJ release of Epstein documents as part of a contact list, with no implication in illegal activities. Since his name has already been disclosed in previous releases, the \"newly released\" files on December 19, 2025 are unlikely to contain his name again as a new revelation.",
