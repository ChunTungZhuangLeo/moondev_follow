  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's 96.3% price is a massive overvaluation against Harris's low true probability, though models differ slightly on the exact figure. For Market 2, all models see a true probability above the market price, but only AI #1 calculates an edge exceeding the 10% trade threshold. Regarding Market 3, the consensus finds Montpellier's market price is overvalued given Grenoble's stronger recent form.",
