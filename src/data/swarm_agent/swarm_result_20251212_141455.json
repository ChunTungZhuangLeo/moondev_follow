This pattern of daily strikes since the ceasefire violations began makes December 13 strikes highly likely. The market seems to underweight the consistency of recent Israeli military actions - they've been striking almost daily. However, edge is just under 10% threshold.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**",
