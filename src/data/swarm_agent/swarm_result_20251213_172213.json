The 4% edge isn't sufficient for the risk, especially in football where defensive performances can surprise. Championship matches are less predictable than this price suggests.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -81% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +81% on NO side\nReasoning: The weather data is definitive - NYC high on December 13 is approximately 40\u00b0F, NOT 42-43\u00b0F. With Winter Weather Advisory and temperatures below average, there's virtually no chance of reaching 42-43\u00b0F. The market is severely mispriced at 86% YES. This is a strong NO bet with massive edge.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (Heroic)\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +13% \u00d7 ~0.92 payout = +12%\nReasoning: Heroic has dominated recent head-to-head matchups with three consecutive victories (2-0, 1-0, 2-0) including their most recent November 7 match. External odds favor Heroic (2.15 vs 1.68), yet Polymarket has them at only 52%. Aurora's recent roster changes add uncertainty. Strong value on Heroic at this price.\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADES:**\n- Market 2: BET NO (81% edge - weather data confirms temp won't reach 42-43\u00b0F)\n- Market 3: BET YES on Heroic (13% edge - recent dominance underpriced)",
