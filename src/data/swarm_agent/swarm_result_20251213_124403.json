  "consensus_summary": "All three AIs agree Market 1 presents a clear 24% edge to bet \"YES\" or \"NO\" (both imply 100% true probability), as the token launch is a confirmed past event. For Market 2, consensus identifies the 83% price as a severe mispricing, though responses disagree on whether to trade \"NO\" or avoid it due to potential data issues. Regarding Market 3, there is no consensus, as the AIs are split between \"YES,\" \"NO,\" and \"NO TRADE,\" indicating high uncertainty.",
