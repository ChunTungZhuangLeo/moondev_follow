Historical data also supports lower temperatures in December. Therefore, it is unlikely that the highest temperature will reach 12\u00b0C.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Given Liverpool's recent inconsistency and the uncertainty surrounding Mohamed Salah's participation, along with Brighton's pattern of drawing matches, a draw is a plausible outcome. Recent developments suggest tensions within Liverpool, which might affect their performance.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Torino FC has been struggling with three consecutive losses and poor recent performances, while US Cremonese has been in better form with two consecutive wins. These factors suggest that Torino is unlikely to secure a win against an in-form Cremonese.",
