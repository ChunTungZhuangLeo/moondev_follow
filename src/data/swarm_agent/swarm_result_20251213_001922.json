As of December 12, 2025, the platform's prediction markets on Polymarket indicate a 5% probability that its fully diluted valuation (FDV) will exceed $8 billion one day after launch. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/market/lighter-market-cap-fdv-6b-one-day-after-launch-324-746-197?utm_source=openai))\n\nEarlier projections were more optimistic. In November 2025, Polymarket data suggested a 72% probability that Lighter's FDV would surpass $1 billion on the day after launch, with a 67% chance of exceeding $2 billion.

This marks a significant improvement compared to the previous year, which saw five bank failures, including major institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/list-of-failed-banks/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has projected that bank failures over the five-year period ending in 2029 will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) approximately $3.3 billion.

The over/under for the game is set at 230.5 points.\n\n**Recent Team Performances:**\n\n- **Chicago Bulls:** The Bulls are on a seven-game losing streak, with their most recent game being a 123-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors. This marked their first game of the season failing to score at least 100 points. Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for greater team effort and attention to detail to break the slump.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 2's 96% price is a severe overestimation, with most AIs recommending a \"NO\" bet due to stabilized banking conditions. For Market 1, most analysts see a low true probability near the market price, resulting in no clear 10%+ edge trade. There is notable disagreement on Market 3, with estimates ranging widely, leading to no unified trading recommendation.",

While Lighter has impressive trading volume ($11B), achieving $8B+ FDV is extremely ambitious for a new DeFi protocol launch. The market sentiment has clearly cooled.

We are now December 13, 2025, with only 18 days remaining in the year. The banking sector has stabilized significantly since the 2023 crisis, Fed support programs exist, and no imminent failures are reported. The 96% YES price seems to be a market error or the question may be asking if there WAS a failure (already resolved YES due to the January failure).

The Hornets have multiple key injuries including LaMelo Ball and are also struggling. Both teams are playing poorly offensively, and the Bulls' recent performance suggests a lower-scoring affair.

Historical DeFi launches rarely achieve such valuations immediately. The market drop from 72% (for $1B) to 6.4% (for $8B) reflects realistic pricing adjustment.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 99%\nMarket Price: 96.0%\nEdge: +3% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low positive, but insufficient\nReasoning: With only 18 days left in 2025 and zero bank failures since January 17, 2025, plus improved banking stability post-2023 crisis, a failure is extremely unlikely.
