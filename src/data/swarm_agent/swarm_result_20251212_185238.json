  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no strong buy opportunities, with all models agreeing Market 3's \"Yes\" is severely overpriced, recommending a \"NO\" bet due to its extreme 92.8% price versus much lower true probability estimates. For Markets 1 and 2, the models generally concur there is insufficient edge (mostly below 10%) to recommend a trade, though they slightly disagree on the true probabilities. Overall, the collective analysis suggests avoiding Markets 1 and 2 while seeing clear value in betting against the high probability in Market 3.",

The market reflects these uncertainties, and while I slightly favor the Blues, the edge is not significant enough to recommend a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 85%  \nMarket Price: 77.8%  \nEdge: +7.2% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +0.072 \u00d7 (1-0.778) = +0.0161  \nReasoning: Despite Heroic's better ranking and strong community support, both teams have similar recent performance.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 33.0%\nEdge: -5% (28% - 33%)\nExpected Value: Not sufficient for trade\nReasoning: Blues covering -1.5 (winning by 2+) is historically difficult in NHL. Their recent 5-2 loss to Boston shows defensive vulnerabilities, though they did beat Ottawa 2-1. Home ice helps but winning by 2+ against any NHL team typically happens ~30-35% of the time. Edge is insufficient.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -2.8% (75% - 77.8%)\nExpected Value: Not sufficient for trade\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked significantly higher (#9 vs #25) and community heavily favors them at 97%. However, both teams have identical 6-10 recent records, suggesting Pipsqueak+4 is competitive. The market at 77.8% seems reasonably priced given the ranking disparity but accounting for Dota 2's inherent volatility in single games.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8% (35% - 92.8%)\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side (~8x return potential)\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. Braunschweig (14th, 14 pts) is playing AWAY at Dynamo Dresden (17th, 13 pts). Both teams are struggling near relegation. Away wins in 2. Bundesliga are uncommon (~30-35%), especially between similarly matched bottom-half teams. Dresden's poor home record (1 win in 7) helps Braunschweig slightly, but a 92.8% win probability for the away team is wildly inflated. Strong NO bet.",

While they beat Ottawa 2-1, that was only a 1-goal margin. Covering -1.5 against any NHL opponent requires dominant form, which Blues haven't shown. Market is fairly priced.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +2.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low (insufficient edge)\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked 9th vs Pipsqueak+4's 25th, and community predicts 97% Heroic win. However, both teams have identical 6-10 recent records, suggesting closer matchup than rankings indicate. Single game variance is high in Dota 2.

Both teams are struggling near relegation (17th vs 14th, separated by 1 point). Dresden has home advantage. A 92.8% probability suggests Braunschweig is a massive favorite, but they're actually slight underdogs in an away relegation battle. Market has severely mispriced this - likely confusion about venue.\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: BET NO on Market 3** - This represents exceptional value with the market overvaluing Braunschweig's chances by approximately 58 percentage points.",
