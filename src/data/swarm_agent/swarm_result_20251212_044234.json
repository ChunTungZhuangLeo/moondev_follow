  "consensus_summary": "The consensus across all AI responses is a definitive \"NO\" for all three markets, with unanimous agreement on Markets 2 and 3 and 4 out of 5 models agreeing on Market 1. The primary reasoning is that despite heightened geopolitical tensions or ongoing legal proceedings, there is no specific, confirmed information indicating the scheduled events will occur by their respective dates. This results in a clear, actionable summary favoring \"NO\" positions due to the absence of concrete evidence for a positive outcome.",

The uncertainty makes it difficult to confidently predict a \"Yes\" or \"No\" outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Similar to Market 1, tensions are high, and the U.S. military presence is significant, but there is no definitive indication of a scheduled military engagement on December 19. The situation remains volatile, but the lack of concrete information suggests a \"No\" trade is too speculative at this point.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol remains in custody with no indications of release by March 31, 2026, and ongoing legal proceedings suggest he is likely to remain detained.

These are posturing and enforcement actions, not combat operations.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While U.S.-Venezuela tensions are elevated with the naval deployment and tanker seizure, a full military engagement on a specific date like December 19 remains highly unlikely. The current operations focus on sanctions enforcement and drug interdiction rather than direct military conflict.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Yoon was re-arrested in July 2025 due to evidence tampering concerns and faces serious charges related to his martial law declaration. Given the ongoing legal proceedings and the gravity of the accusations, release by March 31, 2026 appears unlikely as trials of this magnitude typically take considerable time.",

The pattern of recent No trades reflects appropriate skepticism about specific date predictions.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Yoon was re-arrested in July 2025 with visitor restrictions and ongoing legal proceedings for his martial law declaration.
