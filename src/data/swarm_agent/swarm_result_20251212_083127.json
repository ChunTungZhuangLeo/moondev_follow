  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that the Thunder are likely to win Market 1, but most analysts find the 81% market price already fair, offering no clear 10%+ edge for a trade. For Market 2, there is overwhelming agreement that a 2025 tariff dividend is highly improbable, creating a massive perceived edge to bet \"NO\" against the current high \"YES\" price. On Market 3, opinions on the Cavaliers' spread are split, with no consistent edge meeting the 10% threshold across the analyses.",

However, NBA Cup semifinal in Vegas is a neutral site, and Spurs showed they can compete (beat Lakers 132-119, Castle playing well). The 4% edge is insufficient.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?**\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -89.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Massive on NO side\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:** The news states payments are planned to \"begin by mid-2026\" - NOT 2025. Creating a tariff dividend program requires Congressional approval, administrative infrastructure, and time. We're already in mid-December 2025 with ~3 weeks left. Even with executive action, distributing actual dividend checks to Americans before year-end is logistically impossible. The market appears to be pricing in the ANNOUNCEMENT rather than actual CREATION of the program.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Bet heavily against - market is severely mispriced)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Spread: Cavaliers (-14.5)**\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: -4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low (~-4% edge insufficient)\nReasoning: Cavaliers lost 5 of last 7 games showing real vulnerability. 14.5 points is a massive spread even against the terrible Wizards. Allen returning helps, but covering such a large spread with recent struggles is uncertain. Edge insufficient for trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**",

Spurs showed resilience beating Lakers with Castle's return. Single-elimination tournament creates upset variance that market fairly captures.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -92.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +18.5x on NO bet\nReasoning: Market is betting NO at 97.5% (only 2.5% chance of YES). Trump announced plans for dividends starting \"mid-2026,\" explicitly NOT 2025. The question asks about creation in 2025, which appears virtually impossible given the timeline. NO is correctly priced.\n\n**WAIT - CLARIFICATION NEEDED:** The market shows 97.5% but recent trade was on NO. If 97.5% represents NO probability, then YES is only 2.5%, which seems correct. If 97.5% represents YES probability, this is severely mispriced.\n\nAssuming 97.5% = NO probability (standard interpretation):\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market correctly prices this at ~2.5% chance of happening in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.25 units per dollar (13% edge \u00d7 ~2x payout)\nReasoning: Cavaliers are 14.5-point favorites against the worst team in the NBA. Despite recent struggles (5-7 in last games), they're getting Jarrett Allen back and had 5 days to reset. Wizards are historically weak. 65% probability Cavs cover 14.5 is conservative - market at 52% undervalues Cleveland's talent advantage and Washington's incompetence.",
