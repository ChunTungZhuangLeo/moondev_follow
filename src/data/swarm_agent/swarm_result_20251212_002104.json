With polling showing him in fourth place and no definitive announcement, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both the Chicago Blackhawks and the St. Louis Blues have shown recent capabilities, with the Blackhawks winning against the Rangers and the Blues breaking a losing streak against the Senators. However, with the absence of Jordan Kyrou for the Blues, the match could be closely contested, making it difficult to confidently predict an outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite intensified Russian operations in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces continue to hold Kostiantynivka. Given the ongoing successful defense by Ukraine and the lack of a definitive breakthrough by Russian forces, it seems unlikely that Russia will capture the city by December 31.",
