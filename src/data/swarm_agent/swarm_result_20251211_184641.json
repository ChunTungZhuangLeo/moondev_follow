Recent data on Musk's Twitter activity is limited, making it challenging to predict his posting frequency during this specific period.\n\nIn a related development, on December 5, 2025, the European Commission fined X \u20ac120 million for breaching the Digital Services Act, citing issues such as misleading verification practices and inadequate transparency in advertising. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0a135601e050518d5aa0a0155f973177?utm_source=openai)) Musk criticized the fine, calling it \"bullshit\" and accusing the EU of censorship.

The home advantage and current form momentum support a Ferencv\u00e1rosi win.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Posting 480-499 tweets in an 8-day period requires 60-62 tweets per day, which is extraordinarily high even for Musk's active posting habits.
