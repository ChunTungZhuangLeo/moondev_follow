  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"YES\" for the measles cases, as all models agree the 2025 count will easily exceed 2,000 given the current data. For the Pritzker election market, the majority predicts \"NO,\" citing his focus on a gubernatorial race, though some models advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to the distant timeline. Regarding the Ukraine ceasefire, there is significant disagreement, with predictions split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" reflecting the high uncertainty despite ongoing diplomatic efforts.",

Given the trend and proximity to the target number, it is likely that the number of cases will exceed 2,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: J.B. Pritzker has not declared his candidacy for the 2028 Presidential Election and is currently focused on his gubernatorial bid for a third term. Without a formal campaign or significant momentum towards a presidential run, betting on his victory in 2028 seems premature.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While there are diplomatic efforts, such as Ukraine's revised peace plan and proposals for a demilitarized zone, the market reflects only a 22.5% probability of a ceasefire by March 31, 2026. The geopolitical situation remains highly volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to confidently predict the outcome.",

Winning the presidential election would be highly improbable without even declaring a run.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Recent news highlights significant diplomatic efforts, including Ukraine's revised 20-point peace plan and a U.S. proposal for a \"free economic zone\" in eastern Donbas, suggesting concrete steps toward de-escalation.

With no campaign infrastructure or official candidacy declaration, winning the 2028 presidency is extremely unlikely at this stage.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While there are active peace negotiations and proposals (including the US-proposed economic zone in Donbas), the 22.5% market probability seems reasonably calibrated given the complexity of negotiations and historical difficulty in achieving ceasefires.
