([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inauguration_of_Donald_Trump?utm_source=openai)) The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits any individual from being elected to the presidency more than twice, rendering Trump ineligible for a third term in the 2028 election. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_United_States_presidential_election?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn October 2025, Trump addressed speculation about a potential third term, stating he would \"love to do it\" but ruled out running for vice president in 2028, deeming it \"too cute\" and inappropriate.

Without clear information on Embiid's recovery or other factors, it's uncertain if the 76ers can cover the spread, making this market too uncertain for a confident trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Donald Trump is ineligible to run for a third term as President in 2028 due to the 22nd Amendment. Therefore, he cannot win the 2028 US Presidential Election, making a \"No\" position on this market a straightforward choice.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both the Ottawa Senators and the Columbus Blue Jackets have been struggling, with the Senators losing four of their last five games. The recent low-scoring game for the Senators suggests unpredictability regarding the total goals. Without more recent performance data, it's challenging to confidently predict the total goals, warranting a no-trade decision.",

Joel Embiid's shooting struggles (4-of-21) and the uncertainty around his health make covering a 6.5-point spread risky despite being favorites.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The 22nd Amendment clearly prohibits anyone from being elected president more than twice, and Trump is currently serving his second term. Constitutional amendments require extraordinary political consensus that doesn't exist, making this essentially impossible.\n\nMARKET 3: Over\nReasoning: The recent large trade ($15,660 on Over) suggests informed money is flowing to the over. Both teams have been struggling defensively (Senators lost 4 of 5, Blue Jackets lost 3 straight), and struggling teams often allow more goals, favoring the over 6.5 total.",
