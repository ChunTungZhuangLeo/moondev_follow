The program requires a $15,000 processing fee, followed by a $1 million \"contribution\" for individuals or $2 million for corporations per foreign employee.

On Polymarket, the probability of selling zero Gold Cards in 2025 is currently at 67%, with a trading volume of $1.63 million.

Polymarket's \"Maduro out by...?\" market indicates a 37% chance of Maduro leaving office by March 31, 2026, with a 56% chance by December 31, 2026.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear betting edge for the 76ers spread, with most AIs seeing a roughly 50% true probability.

However, this does not present a strong enough edge for a confident trade.",

A 6.5-point spread is substantial given both teams' inconsistent play.

At $1 million per card targeting wealthy individuals/corporations seeking expedited US residency, it only takes ONE sale to resolve this NO. Given the high-profile launch, wealthy foreign nationals seeking US access, and nearly 3 weeks remaining, the probability of at least one sale completing is much higher than 13%.

Maduro has survived countless crises, sanctions, and opposition movements over years. Despite Machado's optimism, authoritarian leaders rarely leave voluntarily within tight timeframes. Less than 4 months is insufficient for regime change without a dramatic catalyst.",
