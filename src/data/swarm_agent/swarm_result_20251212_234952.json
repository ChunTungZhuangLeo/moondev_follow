The company emphasized its commitment to open-source AI, positioning Llama 4 as a transparent alternative to proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT-5. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/metas-llamacon-was-all-about-undercutting-openai/?utm_source=openai))\n\nLooking ahead, Meta is reportedly developing a successor to the Llama series, codenamed \"Avocado,\" with a target release in the first quarter of 2026.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on Meta releasing Llama 5 in 2025, as news confirms it hasn't happened and the next model is slated for 2026. For the NHL game, opinions are split between a \"YES\" trade on the Sharks (citing recent momentum) and \"NO_TRADE,\" though the edge for \"YES\" is above 10% in several models. There is clear agreement to bet \"YES\" on the soccer match ending in a draw, as multiple external predictions show a probability significantly higher than the market's 24%.",
