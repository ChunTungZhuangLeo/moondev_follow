([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/fixtures/_/id/9812/girona?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **Girona FC:** The team is currently 18th in LaLiga with 12 points, having secured 2 wins, 6 draws, and 6 losses.

For example, an O/U line of 4.5 goals in a soccer match means bettors wager on whether the total goals scored by both teams will be more than 4.5 (over) or fewer than 4.5 (under). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over%E2%80%93under?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the NHL, O/U lines typically range from 5.5 to 6.5 goals, reflecting the league's generally low-scoring nature. Factors influencing these lines include team offensive and defensive strengths, goaltender performance, and recent team trends.

In October 2025, she stated, \"I can't rule anything out at this juncture,\" indicating openness to future possibilities. ([news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/california-brief/whitmer-wont-rule-out-2028-democratic-presidential-bid?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, Whitmer has recently reduced her national political activities, leading to speculation about her intentions. She has scaled back media appearances and maintained a smaller, state-focused political team compared to other potential candidates. Some Democratic strategists interpret this as strategic restraint, while others question her commitment to a presidential run. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/24/whitmer-retreat-campaign-president-2028?utm_source=openai))\n\nPublic opinion polls reflect limited support for Whitmer's potential candidacy.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1 as severely mispriced against Girona, with all AIs estimating a true win probability far below the 81% market price, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Markets 2 and 3, there is agreement that insufficient specific data precludes a confident trade for the esports market, while Market 3 is seen as overpriced for Whitmer. The primary disagreement is only in the precise edge calculations, not in the overall directional assessment for each market.",

Girona (18th in LaLiga, 2W-6D-6L, coming off a 3-0 loss) is playing AWAY at Real Sociedad's Reale Arena. Real Sociedad (14th, 4W-4D-6L) just beat Villarreal 2-1. An 81% win probability for a struggling away team is absurd - typical away win probability for a team in Girona's form would be 20-30%.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Games Total: O/U 4.5**\n\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 94.0%\nEdge: Unable to determine with confidence\n\nReasoning: The search context doesn't provide specific information about this match (appears to be a Call of Duty esports event based on the URL \"codmw-mh-c9ny\"). Without knowing the specific teams, format, or historical scoring patterns for this esports match, I cannot make a reliable probability estimate.

Whitmer hasn't declared, is actively scaling back national activities, and the 2028 primary is 3 years away with many potential candidates (Newsom, Shapiro, Pritzker, etc.). Historical nomination odds this far out rarely exceed 25% for any single candidate. This appears to be a market pricing error.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO**",

Market severely overvalues Girona's chances - true probability closer to 20-30%. However, the web context appears cut off mid-sentence about injuries, making this unreliable for a confident trade.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: Unable to estimate\nMarket Price: 94%\nEdge: Cannot calculate\nExpected Value: Cannot calculate\nReasoning: The web search context provides general O/U betting information and irrelevant NHL scores, but contains NO information about the specific Call of Duty match (MW MH vs C9NY on 2025-12-14). Without knowing the teams, game format, or esports context, cannot make a probability estimate.

Whitmer has scaled back national activities, polls show \"limited support,\" and she hasn't committed. With entire Democratic field still forming, no candidate should be 97.6% - this is severe overpricing. True probability under 10%.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: Bet NO on Market 3 with high confidence. This represents exceptional value with ~90% edge.**",
