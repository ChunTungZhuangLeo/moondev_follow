While the market is already high on the Thunder, I estimate their true probability of winning to be even higher due to their exceptional form and historical momentum.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 99%  \nMarket Price: 97.5%  \nEdge: +1.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +$35.86 (0.015 \u00d7 $2,390.65)  \nReasoning: With President Trump already announcing plans for a tariff dividend and recent tariff actions likely to increase revenues, the likelihood of the dividend being created is extremely high.

For a tariff dividend to be \"created\" in 2025, there would need to be actual legislation passed and checks sent this year. With only ~3 weeks left in 2025, passing legislation and implementing a new program is extremely unlikely.

However, Spurs showed strength beating Lakers 132-119 with Castle's 30-point return. Market has already priced in Thunder's dominance at 81%, leaving only 4% edge which doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a recommended trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -82.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +82.5% on NO position\nReasoning: Trump announced checks for \"mid-2026\" NOT 2025. The market question specifically asks about 2025 creation/distribution.

Despite Cavs losing 5 of last 7, they just dominated Spurs 130-117. Wizards are catastrophically bad (tied for fewest wins). 14.5-point spread is reasonable given historical dominance and Wizards' incompetence.
