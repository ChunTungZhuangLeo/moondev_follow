  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1 as a settled historical event, creating disagreement on whether its 35% price represents a tradable edge or a resolution risk. For Market 2, analysts broadly agree the 81% probability for Maduro's exit is vastly overestimated, favoring a \"NO\" bet. Market 3 shows the least agreement, with assessments split on whether two major earthquakes have already definitively occurred.",

However, this appears to be a different December 12, 2025 match, and without current live data on map pick/veto and current form, I cannot establish sufficient edge. The 35% price for BetBoom seems reasonable given historical data showing Johnny Speeds' Map 2 strength.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Maduro out by January 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 18%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -63%\nExpected Value: Very High (betting NO at 19% for ~5.3x payout)\nReasoning: The search results show a MASSIVE discrepancy - Polymarket itself shows only 21% probability, yet this market shows 81%. This appears to be a data error or I'm misreading the market. If the market truly prices YES at 81%, this is wildly overpriced. Despite US pressure and opposition statements, regime change in 50 days is extremely unlikely - Maduro has survived years of sanctions, protests, and international pressure. The $1,000 NO trade confirms smart money sees this.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will there be exactly 2 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher worldwide by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 81.5%\nEdge: -26.5%\nExpected Value: High (betting NO at 18.5% for ~5.4x payout)\nReasoning: Currently at exactly 2 qualifying earthquakes with 19 days remaining in December. Historical data shows approximately 15-20 magnitude 7.0+ earthquakes annually (~1.3-1.7 per month). The probability of ZERO additional 7.0+ earthquakes in 19 days is roughly 45-55%, making \"exactly 2\" overpriced at 81.5%. The recent December 12 quake was only 6.9 (doesn't count), but seismic activity in the region suggests elevated risk of more events.",

The true probability of this past event is 100%, but the market is trading at 35%, implying participants either don't know the result or are betting on a different match.

The market is for *exactly 2* by year-end, which requires no more to occur in the next 19 days. Given the seismic activity and warnings of potential stronger quakes, the probability of exactly 2 is likely below 50%, making the 81.5% price a significant overvaluation.",

However, the 35% price for BetBoom suggests the market already factors in Johnny Speeds' map advantage. The 5% edge is below our 10% threshold for action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Maduro out by January 31, 2026?**\n\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 81% (NO is priced at 19%, YES at 81%)\nEdge: -4% vs NO side (Your 15% vs Market's 19% for NO)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Despite Machado's rhetoric and US pressure, Maduro has survived similar situations for years with military backing. The market's 19% NO probability (81% YES that he stays) seems roughly accurate. With only 7 weeks until deadline and no concrete transition mechanism, regime change is unlikely but the edge isn't sufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Will there be exactly 2 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher worldwide by December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 81.5%\nEdge: +10.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+10.5% \u00d7 payout \u2248 10.5% return)\nReasoning: Two qualifying earthquakes have already occurred (Dec 8: 7.5 magnitude Japan, Dec 12: 6.9 magnitude which rounds to 7.0). With only 19 days remaining in 2025, the historical rate of 7.0+ earthquakes is approximately 15-20 per year (1-2 per month). The probability of exactly zero more 7.0+ quakes in the next 19 days is roughly 50-60%, making \"exactly 2\" the most likely outcome at ~90%+. The market is underpricing this at 81.5%.",
