  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for Market 2 (YES), with most AIs agreeing the 49.9% price is mispriced versus a ~65% true probability from news.

Market 3 shows unanimous agreement that a 95.9% price for Rubio is vastly overvalued, though estimates of the true probability vary significantly.",
