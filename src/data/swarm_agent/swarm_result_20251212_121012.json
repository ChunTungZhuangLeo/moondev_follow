His focus on key issues such as national security and economic reform aligns with themes that resonate with conservative voters.\n\n- **Public Opinion Polls**: Recent polls indicate that Rubio maintains a solid base of support among Republican voters.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear betting opportunity on Market 3 (Rubio 2028), with all analysts agreeing the 95.9% price is a massive overvaluation, strongly recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Market 1 (Angers), opinions are split between \"YES\" and \"NO\" based on form, showing no unified edge above 10%. Regarding Market 2 (Lighter FDV), most see no trade or a \"NO\" bet due to volatile sentiment, but there is disagreement on whether the edge is sufficient to act.",

However, the 5% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -14.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong (14.9% \u00d7 payout on NO side)\nReasoning: Market sentiment has declined sharply from 72% (for $1B) to 40% (for $3B) in just 5 days, indicating cooling expectations. A $3B FDV requires 3x the valuation of the $1B threshold that was only 72% likely, making the current 49.9% price significantly overvalued.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -93.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Massive (93.9% \u00d7 24.5x payout on NO)\nReasoning: This market is clearly mispriced - it's asking about the 2028 election winner, but we're still in 2025 and Rubio hasn't even declared candidacy. The 95.9% price appears to be confusion with another market or erroneous trading. The 2028 election is 3+ years away with numerous potential candidates.",

The 55% market price seems slightly inflated given Angers' actual home performance. A fair price would be closer to 45%.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$3B one day after launch?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -14.9%\nExpected Value: -14.9% \u00d7 2.0 = -29.8% (on NO side: +14.9% \u00d7 2.0 = +29.8%)\n\nReasoning: The Polymarket Pro data shows only 40% probability for >$3B, down significantly from earlier 72% for >$1B. The declining sentiment and the high bar of $3B FDV (which requires exceptional launch performance even for hyped projects) suggests the market at 49.9% is overpriced. Most crypto launches don't sustain $3B+ FDV day one.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?**\n\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -87.9%\nExpected Value: Massive on NO side\n\nReasoning: This market price appears to be an error or manipulation. There's no confirmation Rubio is even running for 2028. The 2028 election is 3 years away with no declared candidates. No single candidate should have 95.9% probability this far out - even incumbents rarely poll this high.
