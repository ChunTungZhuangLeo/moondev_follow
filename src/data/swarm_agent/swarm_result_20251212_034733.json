Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for increased determination and team effort to break the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets have lost three of their last four games, including a 115-106 defeat to the Denver Nuggets. Coach Charles Lee highlighted the benefit of rest following a busy stretch of six games in ten days.

([kotaku.com](https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-kabuto-first-edition-viral-card-2000649100?utm_source=openai)) This trend has continued, with recent data indicating that the price has climbed to approximately $37.43. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-looks-corner-market-203000007.html/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn early December, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card, raising $51,100 for charity. ([cllct.com](https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/sports-cards/kabuto-king-to-auction-autographed-card-for-charity?utm_source=openai)) This event garnered significant attention, including from notable figures like Logan Paul, who participated in t\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not yet held its January 2026 meeting, so no official decision has been made regarding a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate decrease at that time. However, recent developments and expert analyses provide insight into potential future rate adjustments.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps, bringing it to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%. This marked the third consecutive rate cut, a trend not observed since 2019.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that the Bulls are overvalued at 58%, with most AI models seeing no positive edge. For the Kabuto card, opinions are sharply split between models citing unsustainable momentum (No) versus continued viral growth (Yes). Regarding the Fed, most analysts view an 81% probability for a rate cut as too high, citing internal divisions and the distant timeline.",

Road teams typically have a disadvantage, and while both teams are poor, the Bulls' longer losing streak and 32-point blowout loss suggest deeper issues. Home court advantage for Charlotte in a matchup of struggling teams makes this closer to a coin flip than the market suggests.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -15%\nExpected Value: -15% \u00d7 1.67 = -25% potential return on NO bet\nReasoning: Current price is ~$37.43, meaning the card needs to nearly triple (167% increase) in just 19 days. While \"Kabuto King\" has driven impressive gains from $1 to $37, the momentum required to reach $100 by year-end is extreme. The charity auction shows engagement but doesn't indicate imminent price tripling.

However, \"internal divisions\" among governors and economic uncertainty create some pause risk. The market at 81% seems slightly high given the divisions mentioned, but not by enough margin to warrant a trade. A January pause is possible but the Fed's recent trajectory supports continued cuts.",

While Hornets have also struggled (3 of 4 losses), they're at home and less dysfunctional. The 58% market price significantly overvalues a Bulls team in complete disarray. Coach Donovan's comments about needing \"increased determination\" signal deeper issues than just a slump.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto 1st Edition Card Hits $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability: 15%**\n**Market Price: 40%**\n**Edge: -25% (Your prob - Market)**\n**Expected Value: Massive negative edge favors NO**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** Current price is ~$37.43 as of Dec 12. Reaching $100 requires a 167% gain in just 19 days. While \"Kabuto King\" has manipulated this market from $1 to $37, the charity auction ($51k) was for a SIGNED card, not regular first editions. The pace of increase has slowed significantly (only $28 to $37 recently), and such artificial pumps typically plateau. Market is massively overestimating continuation of this parabolic move.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed Decreases Rates 25bps After January 2026 Meeting\n**Your Probability: 10%**\n**Market Price: 81%**\n**Edge: -71% (Your prob - Market)**\n**Expected Value: Extreme negative edge favors NO**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** The Fed just cut 25bps on Dec 10 (third consecutive cut), but the article explicitly mentions \"significant divisions among Federal Reserve governors\" about future policy. After three straight cuts bringing rates to 3.5-3.75%, the Fed typically pauses to assess impact. With internal divisions and having already delivered substantial easing, another cut in January (just 6 weeks later) is highly unlikely. The 81% market price appears to misunderstand Fed signaling and the typical pause pattern after cutting cycles.",
