Recent analyses suggest a moderate likelihood of both teams scoring in this fixture.

There is unanimous agreement that Market 3 offers no actionable edge, as the estimated true probability for Heroic is roughly equal to its market price.

Historical data shows only 57% chance of BTTS per BetClan algorithm, and recent form shows Leicester won 2-0 (not BTTS). Championship matches are lower scoring than Premier League. This is a clear NO bet, but the NO side is already heavily priced in.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - While this is mispriced, the NO side at 4.1% offers poor risk/reward. Would need massive capital for small return.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 13%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -73.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +292% (73% edge \u00d7 4x payout on NO)\nReasoning: Weather forecast clearly indicates 40-41\u00b0F range (52% probability on related market). The 42-43\u00b0F range has only 13% probability according to Polymarket's own temperature distribution data. Market is severely overpricing this outcome.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Strong conviction bet. The forecast data directly contradicts this price, showing 40-41\u00b0F as most likely outcome.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: -4.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Aurora has won 3 of last 5 encounters historically, though Heroic won most recent 2-0 in November. With limited recent data and Aurora's historical edge, this appears roughly 50/50. The 52% price on Heroic seems approximately fair given mixed recent results.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Insufficient edge. Market is reasonably efficient at ~50/50 pricing for what appears to be a coin-flip match.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 2 - BET NO**\nThis is the only market with sufficient edge (>10%) to justify a trade.
