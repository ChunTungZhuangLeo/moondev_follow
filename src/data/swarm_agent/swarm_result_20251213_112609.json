Despite OG's recent victory, Team Spirit's win against a strong team like Team Liquid and their historical performance suggest they are likely to win Game 1.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The recent match history between Team Yandex and Xtreme Gaming shows mixed outcomes, with both teams securing wins against each other. Given this uncertainty and the lack of clear dominance by either side, it is prudent to avoid taking a position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Keir Starmer's low approval ratings and internal party challenges, there is no concrete indication or announcement of his resignation by June 30, 2026.
