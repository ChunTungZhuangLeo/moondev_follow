  "consensus_summary": "The consensus across all AI responses is a unanimous \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation for all three markets, as none meet the required 10% edge threshold. There is notable disagreement on the true probabilities, especially for Market 1 where estimates range wildly from 5% to 95%, but agreement that the market prices are too efficient or the events are too uncertain to offer a clear, high-conviction opportunity. Overall, the analyses suggest the current market odds are reasonably accurate, providing no actionable betting edges according to the given criteria.",

However, 97.6% seems slightly overconfident given variability in any single event. The event may have already occurred (Dec 12), and without confirmation of the outcome, the high price suggests insiders know the result.

Vegas has this as a significant spread game. While the Titans showed life last week with Pollard's big game, the 49ers on a 3-game win streak at home are rightfully favored. 88% is slightly high but within reasonable range - no meaningful edge exists.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Browns vs. Bears**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.0%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge for NO bet\nReasoning: Bears (9-4) at home favored by 7.5 points against Browns (3-10) is appropriate. However, Shedeur Sanders showed promise last week (364 yards, 4 TDs), and NFL games between bad teams can be unpredictable. 77% feels slightly high for a 7.5-point spread (typically implies ~70% win probability), but the edge isn't sufficient to recommend a NO position.",

No public information confirms Trump said \"terrible/horrible\" 4+ times, but market is pricing near-certainty. Insufficient edge and event likely already resolved.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 88.0%\nEdge: +4.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient for 10% threshold\nReasoning: 49ers (9-4) heavily favored at home against Titans (2-11), one of NFL's worst teams. 49ers on 3-game win streak. However, edge is only 4%, below our 10% minimum threshold for trade recommendation.\n\n**DECISION: NO_TRADE** (Edge insufficient despite favorable matchup)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 77.0%\nEdge: +8.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Positive but below threshold\nReasoning: Bears (9-4) are 7.5-point favorites at home against Browns (3-10).

The NFL markets are efficient with sharp money already reflected in prices.",
