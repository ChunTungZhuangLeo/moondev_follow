  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 3 as severely mispriced with a strong agreement to bet \"NO,\" given the market's 92.8% price starkly contradicts Braunschweig's underdog status. For Markets 1 and 2, opinions are split on direction, but all analysts agree the edges are below the 10% threshold, resulting in a collective \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation for both. Overall, the only clear actionable trade with a significant edge is against Braunschweig winning.",

Their recent 5-2 loss to Boston shows defensive vulnerabilities, and while they beat Ottawa 2-1, that wouldn't have covered -1.5.

Braunschweig is playing AWAY at Dresden, and betting odds show Dresden favored at 2.10 vs Braunschweig at 3.60 for an away win. Braunschweig's recent form (1W-2D-2L) is worse than Dresden's (2W-3L).

While they beat Ottawa 2-1, covering a -1.5 spread requires winning by 2+ goals. Against a division rival at home, this is close to fair value but slightly overpriced.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: While Heroic is ranked higher (#9 vs #25), both teams have identical 6-4 records in last 10 matches.
