  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Fight to Go the Distance?\nCurrent Market Price: 52.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,201.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/ufc-gil-ama3-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific information available regarding a prediction market titled \"Fight to Go the Distance.\" This could be due to the market being relatively new, niche, or not widely covered in mainstream news sources.\n\nHowever, the concept of prediction markets, particularly in the realm of sports events like Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), has been gaining traction. For instance, a study titled \"FightTracker: Real-time predictive analytics for Mixed Martial Arts bouts\" developed a data-driven solution that delivers real-time predictions for UFC fights. This system achieved 80% accuracy in predicting fight outcomes and demonstrated a 90.17% return on investment over an 8-week period against a bookmaker. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11067?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into prediction markets is a growing trend. AI models are increasingly being used to analyze financial news and predict market movements. \n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will FC Groningen win on 2025-12-13?\nCurrent Market Price: 31.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $4,635.64 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/ere-gro-vol-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nFC Groningen is set to face FC Volendam in an Eredivisie match on December 13, 2025, at Euroborg in Groningen. Recent analyses and betting odds suggest that FC Groningen is favored to win.\n\n**Recent Form:**\n- FC Groningen has struggled recently, failing to secure a win in their last five matches. ([welcome.bet](https://welcome.bet/groningen-vs-volendam-predictions-dec-13-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n- FC Volendam has managed to secure victories in two of their last five games. ([welcome.bet](https://welcome.bet/groningen-vs-volendam-predictions-dec-13-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Betting Odds:**\n- Bookmakers have favored FC Groningen to come out on top with odds of 1.5, while FC Volendam has odds of 6.25 for an away victory. ([welcome.bet](https://welcome.bet/groningen-vs-volendam-predictions-dec-13-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n- Other sources indicate odds of 1.42 for a Groningen win, 4.7 for a draw, and 7.0 for a Volendam victory.

Wembanyama is expected to return for this game, though he will be on a minutes restriction.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no actionable edge for Market 1 due to a lack of specific information. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement on interpreting the bookmaker odds versus recent form, leading to conflicting trade recommendations.
