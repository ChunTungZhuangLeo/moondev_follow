Predictions about the Second Coming have been a subject of speculation and debate for centuries, often without fulfillment.\n\nIn recent years, various individuals and groups have proposed specific dates for Jesus' return. For instance, in September 2025, South African pastor Joshua Mhlakela claimed to have received a vision stating that Jesus would return on September 23 and 24, 2025. This prediction gained attention and led to widespread discussion on social media platforms, particularly under the hashtag #RaptureTok. However, these dates have passed without any event matching the prophecy, leading to skepticism and criticism of such predictions.

In that game, Penn State defeated Michigan State 28-10, snapping a six-game losing streak. Kaytron Allen led the Nittany Lions with a career-high 181 rushing yards and two touchdowns, while quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer threw two touchdown passes to Devonte Ross. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/cfb/allen-ross-each-score-twice-in-penn-states-2810-win-over-michigan-state?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn men's basketball, the two teams are set to face off today, December 13, 2025, at 12 p.m. EST in University Park, Pennsylvania. Penn State enters the game with an 8-2 record, while Michigan State is 8-1. The Nittany Lions are aiming to extend their three-game home winning streak. Key players for Penn State include Kayden Mingo, who averages 15.4 points per game, and Freddie Filione V, who contributes 13.3 points\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Metamask FDV above $3B one day after launch?\nCurrent Market Price: 71.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,664.89 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/metamask-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no official announcement or credible news indicating that MetaMask has launched its own token with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $3 billion. The prediction market \"MetaMask FDV above ___ one day after launch?\" on Polymarket, which allows users to speculate on the FDV of MetaMask's token post-launch, is still active and has not resolved, suggesting that the token has not been launched yet. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/metamask-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the absence of an official MetaMask token, the MASK token associated with Mask Network is often mistakenly referred to as \"MetaMask's token.\" As of now, MASK is trading at $0.608515 USD, with an intraday high of $0.613879 USD and a low of $0.590545 USD.\n\nIt's important to note that Mask Network is a separate project from MetaMask, and any developments regarding Mask Network's token do not pertain to MetaMask's potential token launch.\n\nIn summary, \n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1 (\"Jesus Christ return\") as having a near-zero true probability, with all AIs agreeing the market price is severely overvalued, though they disagree on whether the edge is actionable. For Markets 2 and 3, the AIs collectively find the current prices overconfident, implying trades on \"NO\" are favored, but they vary significantly in their specific probability estimates. Overall, the analyses concur that these markets present potential negative edges against their high prices, with the strongest agreement on Market 1's mispricing.",
