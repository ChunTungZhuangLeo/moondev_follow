However, prediction markets on Polymarket have been active in estimating his tweet frequency during this period. The market \"Elon Musk # tweets December 9 - December 16, 2025?\" has seen significant trading volume, with various outcomes reflecting different tweet count ranges. For instance, the 320-339 tweet range has a 9% chance, while the 400-419 range has an 11% chance. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese markets indicate that participants anticipate a higher tweet count than the 320-339 range, with the 400-419 range being the most probable.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly identifies Market 1's 91% price as a severe overvaluation, with most AIs estimating a true probability below 30% and recommending a NO bet. For Market 2, opinions are split between a marginal NO_TRADE and a confident YES bet on the Nets, reflecting disagreement on whether the Mavericks' injury creates a sufficient edge. Regarding Market 3, there is clear agreement that MOUZ is overvalued at 83%, leading to a collective NO recommendation against them.",

Given the speculative nature of this market and the likelihood that Musk will exceed the 320-339 range, the market appears to be significantly overvaluing the YES outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 26.0%\nEdge: +9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +9% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: The Brooklyn Nets have shown recent improvement, and the Dallas Mavericks are dealing with a key injury.

The 91% price shown appears to be an error or I'm misreading the market - if the market truly shows 91% for this narrow range, it's massively overpriced given historical tweet patterns suggest much higher volumes are expected.\n\n**MARKET 2: Nets vs. Mavericks**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 26%\nEdge: +2%\nReasoning: The Nets have won 3 of their last 4 games and are playing well under Fern\u00e1ndez, while the Mavericks are missing Dereck Lively II. However, Dallas at home with Cooper Flagg performing well still makes them strong favorites. The 26% for Brooklyn seems roughly fair, maybe slightly undervalued but not enough edge to trade.\n\n**MARKET 3: Dota 2: MOUZ vs Virtus.pro (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 83%\nEdge: -8%\nReasoning: MOUZ has a 69% win rate and beat VP twice in October, but they've recently lost 0-2 to top teams like Tundra and Team Falcons.

This market is asking about YES on 320-339, but the data suggests higher ranges are more likely. The 91% price is completely disconnected from the 9% probability shown in the broader market data. However, this appears to be a data inconsistency issue - if this is truly at 91%, something is wrong with the market mechanics. NO_TRADE due to confusion in market structure.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 40%\nMarket Price: 26.0%\nEdge: +14% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +14% \u00d7 2.85 payout = +40% EV\nReasoning: Nets have won 3 of last 4 games with strong performances (119-101 vs Pelicans, Porter Jr. 35 points, Claxton triple-double). Mavericks lost Dereck Lively II for the season - a significant injury to their starting center. The 26% price undervalues Brooklyn's recent momentum and Dallas's major injury loss. Home court advantage for Dallas is priced in too heavily.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 83.0%\nEdge: -5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: MOUZ has 69% win rate recently and 2-0 head-to-head wins vs VP in October, supporting their favoritism. However, recent 0-2 losses to top teams (Tundra, Falcons) show vulnerability. VP's 2-0 Round 2 win indicates improving form. The 83% price is slightly high but only 5% edge isn't enough to justify a NO bet given MOUZ's overall stronger position.",
