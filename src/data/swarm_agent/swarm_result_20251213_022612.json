His approval ratings have remained high, with a 68% approval rating in early 2025, making him the highest-approved Democratic governor at that time.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly favors \"No\" for the US-Venezuela military engagement market, with four AIs agreeing the 2.5% probability is far below the 20% threshold. For the basketball game, most AIs predict a South Dakota win due to Prairie View's poor road record, though some advise against trading due to uncertainty. Regarding Andy Beshear, the majority predicts \"No\" for his 2028 nomination, citing the early stage and unannounced candidacy despite his strong credentials.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Prairie View A&M Panthers recently had a significant victory, their 0-4 away record suggests they struggle on the road. Meanwhile, South Dakota Coyotes have a decent 4-2 home record but are coming off a losing streak. The mixed performance of both teams makes this market uncertain, and thus not a strong betting opportunity.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The recent trade data shows the probability of a US-Venezuela military engagement by the end of the year is very low, at 2.5%. Although tensions have risen due to the oil tanker seizure, the likelihood of military engagement remains significantly below the 20% threshold, making \"No\" the favorable position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Andy Beshear has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, and while he has a strong approval rating, it's too early to predict his chances of winning the nomination. The uncertainty surrounding his candidacy and other potential candidates in the race makes it difficult to take a definitive position at this time.",

The home court advantage and road struggles make South Dakota the better pick.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The underlying market for US-Venezuela military engagement is currently trading at only 2.5%, which is far below the 20% threshold needed. While tensions exist over the oil tanker seizure, there's no indication this will escalate to actual military engagement within weeks.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While Beshear has strong credentials and high approval ratings, he hasn't declared candidacy and the 2028 nomination is highly competitive with many potential candidates. At this early stage with no formal announcement, betting NO on any single candidate winning the nomination is prudent given the uncertainty.",
