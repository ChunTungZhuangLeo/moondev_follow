([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/442de589de9b99bb811f76e402b00948?utm_source=openai)) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects that the federal funds rate will average 3.4% by the end of 2026, indicating a potential for one additional 25 basis point rate cut in 2026.

([federalreserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a1.htm?utm_source=openai)) This decision reflects ongoing efforts to support economic growth amid a cooling labor market and persistent inflationary pressures.\n\n**Federal Reserve Projections:**\n\nIn its latest projections, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates only one additional 25 basis point rate cut in 2026, maintaining the outlook from September. ([tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate/news/463954?utm_source=openai)) This cautious stance indicates a preference for gradual policy adjustments in response to evolving economic conditions.\n\n**Market Expectations:**\n\nDespite the Fed's conservative projections, several major financial institutions continue to forecast a total of 50 basis points i...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Over $200M committed to the Gensyn public sale?\nRecent trade: $3,937.10 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/gensyn-public-sale-total-commitments\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nGensyn, a decentralized AI computing infrastructure provider, is set to launch its public AI token sale on December 15, 2025, through the Sonar platform. The sale will offer 300 million tokens, representing 3% of the total supply, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) ranging from $100 million to $1 billion.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"YES\" for one Fed rate cut in 2026, based on the Fed's own projections, while predictions for two cuts are split, reflecting a debate between official guidance and more aggressive institutional forecasts. For the Gensyn sale, the majority predicts \"NO\" on reaching $200M, citing the ambitious scale relative to the token allocation, though one model abstained due to high speculation. Overall, the Fed's official outlook creates high confidence for one cut but uncertainty for two, and the crypto market prediction leans skeptical on the fundraising target.",

While some financial institutions predict more aggressive cuts, the Fed's own projections are more conservative.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Although Gensyn's token sale offers significant incentives and has a high fully diluted valuation potential, the recent trade on \"No\" and the fact that Gensyn has previously secured $50 million in funding suggest skepticism about reaching the $200 million commitment threshold for the public sale.",

This official guidance makes \"1 cut\" the most likely baseline.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While some banks forecast two cuts, the Federal Reserve's official December 2025 projection explicitly anticipates only one additional 25bps rate cut in 2026, making two cuts less probable than the Fed's own stated path.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The context provides the sale structure and valuation range but no concrete data on pre-commitment levels; reaching $200M depends heavily on volatile market demand at launch, making this highly speculative without clearer indicators.",

With the Fed explicitly forecasting this and major institutions like Goldman Sachs predicting multiple cuts, at least one cut is highly probable.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: While the Fed officially projects only one cut, Goldman Sachs and other major institutions forecast two cuts (March and June 2026) bringing rates to 3.0-3.25%. Given current economic conditions and the Fed's dovish pivot, two cuts appears more likely than the conservative official guidance suggests.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The recent $3,937 trade on No suggests skepticism about reaching $200M. With a $100M-$1B FDV range and only 300M tokens (3% supply) being offered, reaching $200M in commitments would require very strong demand. The token sale structure and relatively modest previous funding ($50M+ in seed/Series A) makes this threshold ambitious.",
