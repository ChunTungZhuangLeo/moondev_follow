      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: Both Leicester City and Ipswich Town have shown strong attacking form recently, with Leicester averaging 1.8 goals per game and Ipswich 1.83 goals per game in their last five matches. This suggests a high likelihood of both teams scoring in their upcoming encounter.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Fulham has been scoring at a decent rate (1.83 goals per game), Burnley's poor form and low scoring (0.67 goals per game) create uncertainty around reaching the over 1.5 goals mark. The mixed form of both teams makes this market too unpredictable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The forecast of snow and a Winter Weather Advisory suggests temperatures are likely to remain below the 42-43\u00b0F range. The advisory indicates colder conditions expected on December 13, supporting a bet on \"No\" for this temperature range.",

The recent scoring form for both teams suggests BTTS is likely.\n\nMARKET 2: Over\nReasoning: Despite Burnley's poor form, they're conceding over 2 goals per game while Fulham scores at 1.83 goals per game. Even with Burnley's offensive struggles (0.67 goals/game), Fulham's attacking output alone makes Over 1.5 goals highly probable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Winter Weather Advisory with snow forecasted suggests temperatures will likely be lower than the 42-43\u00b0F range, as significant snowfall typically occurs at temperatures below 40\u00b0F. The recent trade of $562.84 on No aligns with this weather forecast.",

Burnley's defensive struggles combined with Fulham's scoring rate strongly suggests total goals will exceed 1.5, supported by the recent $800 bet on Over.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: NYC has a Winter Weather Advisory with 2-4 inches of snow forecast and significant winter weather impacts expected on December 13.
