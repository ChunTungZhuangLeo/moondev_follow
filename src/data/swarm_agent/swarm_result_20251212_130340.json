Their most recent matchup occurred on March 7, 2025, when the Cavaliers narrowly defeated the Hornets 118-117. In that game, Donovan Mitchell led the Cavaliers with 24 points, while Miles Bridges scored a career-high 46 points for the Hornets.

The largest earthquake in recent history was the 2025 Kamchatka earthquake, which occurred on July 29, 2025, with a magnitude of 8.8. This event was the most powerful earthquake recorded worldwide since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and is tied with the 1906 Ecuador-Colombia and 2010 Chile earthquakes as the sixth-strongest ever recorded by seismometers.

The study investigated the preparatory processes of this significant subduction event, noting a pronounced approximately 20-year quiescent interval beginning around mid-2003, followed by an abrupt activation that commenced with the M7.4 foreshock on July 20, 2025\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will GenesisCupChampion win the Genesis Cup?\nCurrent Market Price: 65.6% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $772.22 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/genesis-cup-winner\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe Genesis Cup is a prediction market event hosted on Polymarket, focusing on the outcome of the Hive x Betmoar Genesis Cup trading competition, which is scheduled to conclude on December 16, 2025.

However, the market already prices this in well at 76%. Home court advantage for Cleveland and their recent form justify a slight edge, but not enough to trade.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: 10.0 or above earthquake before 2027?**\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 95.8% (for NO)\nEdge: -93.8% on YES side / The market shows 95.8% NO probability\nExpected Value: N/A - market is correctly priced for NO\n\nWait - let me re-read this. The market price of 95.8% appears to be for NO (given the $917.95 trade on No). A magnitude 10.0+ earthquake has NEVER been recorded in human history. The largest ever was the 1960 Chile earthquake at 9.5. The probability of a 10.0+ before 2027 is essentially 0-1%.\n\nYour Probability: 1% (for YES)\nMarket Price: 4.2% (for YES, if 95.8% is NO)\nEdge: -3.2%\nReasoning: A 10.0+ earthquake has never occurred in recorded history. The recent 8.8 Kamchatka quake doesn't change this - we'd need something unprecedented.

Cavaliers are the stronger team with better recent form, but without confirmed game details or current rosters/injuries, the 76% price seems fair for a Cavs home game against the struggling Hornets.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 0.1%\n**Market Price:** 4.2% (100% - 95.8% = NO side)\n**Edge:** -4.1% (Market overvalues YES by 4.1%)\n**Expected Value:** Strong negative for YES, but insufficient edge for NO trade\n**Reasoning:** A magnitude 10.0+ earthquake has NEVER been recorded in human history. The largest ever was 9.5 (Chile 1960). The recent Kamchatka 8.8 was exceptional, and magnitude scales are logarithmic - a 10.0 would be ~32x more powerful than a 9.0. This is essentially impossible in the next 2 years.\n\n**DECISION:** NO_TRADE (While YES is wildly overpriced at 95.8%, the NO side at 4.2% doesn't meet our 10% edge threshold given liquidity concerns)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 62%\n**Market Price:** 65.6%\n**Edge:** -3.6% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Slightly negative\n**Reasoning:** GenesisCupChampion (Holy_Moses7) is the current leader with 62% probability per recent data, but the competition doesn't end until December 16th. With 4 days remaining, the leader can change. Market price of 65.6% seems slightly high but within reasonable bounds given current standings.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n**Recommended Trades:** NONE\n\nAll three markets lack sufficient edge (10%+) to justify a trade:\n- Market 1: Fairly priced\n- Market 2: YES is grossly overpriced (should be ~0.1% not 95.8%), but NO side doesn't offer 10%+ edge\n- Market 3: Slightly overpriced but within margin of error\n\n**Note on Market 2:** This is the most mispriced market - a 10.0 earthquake is geophysically nearly impossible, yet YES is trading at 95.8%. However, betting NO at 4.2% doesn't meet our edge threshold.",
