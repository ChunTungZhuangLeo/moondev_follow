  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no actionable trade for Market 1 due to minimal edge, while all analysts agree on a significant 'Over' bet for Market 2 given Arsenal's offensive strength versus Wolverhampton's weak defense. For Market 3, analysts disagree on direction, but concur the market price is inefficient due to the uncertainty surrounding Liverpool's form and Salah's status. Overall, Market 2 presents the clearest opportunity with a unanimous recommendation and an estimated edge well above the 10% threshold.",
