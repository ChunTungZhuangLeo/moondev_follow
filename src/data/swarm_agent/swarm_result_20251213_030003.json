This lack of data makes it challenging to assess their current form and strategies.\n\n**Match Context:**\n\nThis encounter marks the first meeting between ZSM and LGD Gami\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Donald Trump be on the Time 2025 person of the year shortlist?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.7% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $12,597.23 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/who-makes-times-2025-person-of-the-year-shortlist\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Time magazine has not released an official shortlist for its 2025 Person of the Year. However, various prediction markets and expert analyses have identified several potential contenders, including President Donald Trump.\n\n**Prediction Markets:**\n\n- **Polymarket:** A market focused on the 2025 Person of the Year has seen significant activity. As of the latest data, the probability of Donald Trump being included in the shortlist is approximately 85%. This suggests a strong expectation among participants for his inclusion. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/who-makes-times-2025-person-of-the-year-shortlist/will-donald-trump-be-on-the-time-2025-person-of-the-year-shortlist?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **OLBG:** In their betting odds, Donald Trump is listed as a 2/1 favorite, indicating a 33.3% implied probability of being named Person of the Year.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is overpriced, with most models recommending a \"NO\" bet due to a significant negative edge. For Market 3, there is notable disagreement, as some models see a large positive edge for \"YES\" while others advise against trading.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Low negative\nReasoning: LGD Gaming is an established LPL team with recent competitive results (2-0 vs Ultra Prime), while ZSM has limited tournament history and data. However, the Demacia Cup often sees upsets and ZSM could be a developmental roster. The 5% edge is insufficient to justify a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 95%\nMarket Price: 97.7%\nEdge: -2.7%\nReasoning: Trump is almost certain to be on the shortlist given he's the sitting US President in 2025 and a perennial newsmaker. Time consistently includes the US President on shortlists. However, at 97.7%, there's minimal value betting YES, and the ~3% chance he's excluded (perhaps if Time changes format) doesn't provide enough edge to bet NO.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 80%\nEdge: +12%\nExpected Value: 12% \u00d7 0.25 (payout on YES at 80%) = +3% EV\nReasoning: The market appears to be for Kyrgios winning at 80%. In Battle of the Sexes format matches with modified rules to \"level the playing field,\" the physical advantages men have in tennis (serve speed, power, court coverage) remain overwhelming. Even with Kyrgios returning from injury and Sabalenka being world #1, the physiological gap in professional tennis is too significant. Historical data and the inherent physical differences suggest Kyrgios should win 90%+ of the time even with rule modifications.",

However, the 5% edge is insufficient for a confident trade given the uncertainty around ZSM's current form and the limited head-to-head history.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 97.7%\nEdge: -12.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive EV on NO side\nReasoning: While Trump is a strong contender (prediction markets show ~85% probability for shortlist inclusion), the current 97.7% price severely overvalues certainty. Time's shortlist typically includes 5-10 people, and there's real ~15% chance Trump is excluded for editorial reasons or to avoid predictability. Recent $12k NO trade suggests smart money recognizes this mispricing.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 80%\nEdge: +12% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive EV on Kyrgios side\nReasoning: Despite modified rules attempting to level the field, the physical advantages in tennis (serve speed, power) heavily favor male professional players even against top female players. Kyrgios, even with injury concerns, has overwhelming historical precedent on his side - no top-10 female player has beaten a male professional in serious competition. The 80% price undervalues the biological reality of the matchup.",
