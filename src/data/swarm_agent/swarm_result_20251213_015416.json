  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no trade recommendations meeting the 10% edge threshold, with most models agreeing Market 1's \"No\" outcome is overpriced and Market 2's \"Over\" is heavily overvalued. The only notable disagreement is on Market 3, where one model sees a 14% edge for the Jazz, while others find it insufficient for a trade. Overall, the collective analysis suggests the current market prices are efficient or offer negative expected value for the specified trades.",

Given the remaining time frame and considering current news, a slight chance exists that any of these leaders could be removed from power, but the market already prices a high probability for stability.  \n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 75%  \nMarket Price: 89.0%  \nEdge: -14% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Negative  \nReasoning: The Grizzlies have been performing well even without Ja Morant, and his potential return could enhance their scoring.

Netanyahu faces ongoing legal/political pressure, Khamenei is elderly (85+), and geopolitical situations remain volatile.

The Grizzlies have been winning but playing solid defense recently. Ja Morant returning from injury typically means he'll be on minutes restriction. The Jazz are a lower-tempo team this season. 233.5 is a high total, and while both teams can score, this market is severely mispriced.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Bet Under/Against Over)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -21% (35% - 56%)\nExpected Value: Positive for Grizzlies 1H (betting NO at 44% implied)\nReasoning: The Jazz are road underdogs (+6.5), and the Grizzlies are 7-2 in their last 9 with strong home court advantage. Ja Morant potentially returning adds firepower. The market pricing Jazz at 56% to win the first half seems wildly inconsistent with them being 6.5-point underdogs for the full game.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Bet Grizzlies 1H)",

Trump just took office, Putin/Khamenei are entrenched autocrats, Netanyahu survived recent challenges, Starmer is newly elected, Zelenskyy has wartime support, and even Maduro remains despite opposition. However, 91% slightly overprices stability - unexpected health events, coups, or resignations remain possible. Edge insufficient for trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: O/U 233.5\n**Your Probability:** 82%\n**Market Price:** 89%\n**Edge:** -7% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Negative\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n**Reasoning:** The 233.5 total is relatively high for an NBA game. While Grizzlies are hot (7-2 in last 9) and Ja Morant may return, Jazz have been struggling. Grizzlies' defensive improvements during their winning streak could suppress scoring. Market at 89% OVER seems slightly aggressive given defensive trends and Jazz's offensive struggles. Edge is 7%, below 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline\n**Your Probability:** 72%\n**Market Price:** 56%\n**Edge:** +16% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive (+16% \u00d7 ~0.79 payout = +12.6%)\n**Decision:** YES\n\n**Reasoning:** Market severely underpricing Grizzlies' first-half dominance. Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games, plays at home, and likely gets Ja Morant back. Jazz are struggling badly this season. Grizzlies typically start games strong at FedExForum. The 56% price for Memphis 1H appears to reflect uncertainty about Morant, but even without him they've been excellent. Strong edge on YES (Grizzlies 1H).",
