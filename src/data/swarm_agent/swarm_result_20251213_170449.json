Ipswich has only conceded 0.5 goals per game in their last 6 matches, showing strong defensive form. Historical BTTS rates in Championship matches typically hover around 50-60%. This market appears to be a trap or pricing error.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will the highest temperature in New York City be between 42-43\u00b0F on December 13?**\n\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -81%\nExpected Value: Extremely strong NO value\n\nReasoning: The hourly forecast shows temperatures peaking at only 40\u00b0F at 3 PM, then declining. Current high is 40\u00b0F and no warming is expected. The forecast clearly indicates the high will NOT reach 42-43\u00b0F - it will stay in the 37-40\u00b0F range.

Head-to-head is 5-5 with 3 ties, suggesting very even matchup. The 52% price seems reasonable given recent form slightly favoring Heroic.

Market is significantly overpricing BTTS probability - this is a fade opportunity but requires betting NO.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Would need to bet NO for value, but edge calculation shows this is overpriced on YES side)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -81.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Current high is 40\u00b0F and hourly forecast shows temperatures declining through the day, peaking at 40\u00b0F around 3-4 PM.
