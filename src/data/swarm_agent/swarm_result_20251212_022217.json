If resolution-relevant information is not available by that date, the market will remain open until January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET.

In November 2025, Lighter secured a $68 million funding round led by Founders Fund, Ribbit Capital, Haun Ventures, and Robinhood Markets, achieving a valuation of $1.5 billion.

As of December 10, 2025, a Polymarket prediction market indicates a 2.1% chance that Lighter's fully diluted valuation (FDV) will exceed $10 billion one day after launch, with a trading volume of $187.8K and 40 active participants.

However, recent developments indicate significant challenges to his leadership.\n\n**Internal Party Crisis:**\nThe Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) is grappling with internal turmoil due to corruption and sexual harassment allegations. Notably, Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e9, president of the Diputaci\u00f3n de Lugo, resigned following accusations of sexual harassment. Additionally, former PSOE member Leire D\u00edez and ex-president of the State Industrial Participation Company (SEPI), Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, were detained on corruption charges. These incidents have severely impacted the party's public image and internal morale.

Overall, the AI responses show high agreement on the two tech-focused markets based on probability and valuation data, but are divided on the political outcome.",

Given the predicted trajectory of AI development and the lack of any disqualifying events occurring as of December 12, 2025, it seems likely that at least one of the specified events will happen, leading to a \"No\" resolution.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite Lighter's strong funding and growth, the prediction market indicates only a 2.1% chance of its fully diluted valuation exceeding $10 billion one day after launch. This suggests that while Lighter is promising, reaching such a high valuation immediately post-launch is unlikely, especially considering its current valuation of $1.5 billion.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Although there is no official announcement of Pedro S\u00e1nchez stepping down, the internal crisis within PSOE, coupled with public dissatisfaction and significant challenges to his leadership, increases the likelihood of him being out as PM in 2025. The recent turmoil and public opinion suggest potential for a change in leadership.",

The market correctly prices this at only ~2% probability, and there's no compelling edge to bet against this consensus.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite internal PSOE scandals and poor public opinion, with only ~19 days left in 2025 and no official resignation announcement, the probability of S\u00e1nchez leaving office this year is very low.

The market correctly prices that \"nothing will happen.\"\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Lighter raised $68M at a $1.5B valuation in November 2025, making a >$10B FDV (6.7x jump) one day after token launch extremely unlikely. The current 2.1% probability seems appropriate, and the recent $575 bet on No aligns with this assessment.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite corruption scandals affecting PSOE party members and negative public opinion (59.3% want him to resign), there's no indication of imminent resignation with only ~2.5 weeks left in 2025.
