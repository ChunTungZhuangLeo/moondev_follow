This disparity in performance makes it unlikely for Norwich City to win.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Lille OSC is coming off a victory against a strong team like Olympique Marseille and is generally a higher-tier team compared to US Lusitanos de Saint-Maur. Given their recent form and the level difference, it is unlikely that the match will end in a draw.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The head-to-head record between CYBERSHOKE Esports and 500 is mixed, with each team having recently won against the other. The win rates are close as well, making the outcome of their Map 2 encounter uncertain. Therefore, taking a position in this market presents a high level of risk.",
