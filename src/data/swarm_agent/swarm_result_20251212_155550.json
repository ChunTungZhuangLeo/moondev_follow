The 76ers are favored by 6.5 points in this matchup.

Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. Joel Embiid struggled offensively, shooting 4-of-21 from the field.

The program requires a $15,000 processing fee, followed by a $1 million \"contribution\" for individuals or $2 million for corporations per foreign employee.

On Polymarket, the probability of selling zero Gold Cards in 2025 is currently at 67%, with a trading volume of $1.63 million. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/will-trump-sell-0-gold-cards-in-2025?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, Kalshi reports a 35% chance of zero cards sold, with the average market estimate around 57 cards.

Reports suggest that \"elements within the Cuban regime\" have engaged in discussions with U.S. officials about a post-Maduro Venezuela, although Cuba has publicly denied these contacts. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/elements-within-cuba-have-contacted-us-officials-about-maduro-sources-say-2025-12-05/?utm_source=openai))\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has also met with Venezuelan officials, expressing support for Maduro and indicating potential asylum options, highlighting the international d\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no clear 10%+ edge on Market 1, viewing the spread as a roughly 50/50 proposition. For Market 2, most AIs strongly disagree with the high market price, believing the probability of zero Gold Card sales is significantly lower than 87%. On Market 3, opinions are split, with some seeing a strong edge for \"YES\" due to international pressure, while others find the price reasonable, preventing a unified trade recommendation.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 46.7%\nEdge: -4.7%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The 76ers are favored at home but Embiid's recent poor shooting (4-21) is concerning. A 6.5 point spread is substantial, and with the Pacers winning their last two games and showing improvement, the 76ers covering seems like a coin flip. The market price is reasonable given the uncertainty around Embiid's form.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -62%\nExpected Value: High (betting NO at 13% for significant upside)\nReasoning: The program just launched on December 11, 2025, with a $1M price tag. There are wealthy individuals and corporations globally who would pay this for expedited U.S. residency - even just ONE sale makes this resolve NO. With nearly 3 weeks left in 2025 and the program actively processing applications, the probability of at least one sale is very high. The 87% for ZERO sales is drastically mispriced given the program is now live.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -6%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: While international pressure is mounting and there are diplomatic discussions about post-Maduro scenarios, authoritarian leaders typically don't leave power quickly absent military coups or death. Maduro has survived previous crises and maintains military support. The 61% seems slightly optimistic but not enough to justify a trade given the genuine uncertainty and potential for unexpected developments.",

Pacers have won 2 straight and are showing momentum. The 76ers covering -6.5 is less likely than market suggests - this is a NO bet opportunity.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -7.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge for trade\nReasoning: The Gold Card program just launched on Dec 11, 2025 with a $1M+ price tag. While the high price point makes zero sales plausible, the program is brand new and there are still 19 days left in December. The 7% edge is insufficient to justify the risk given the uncertainty of a just-launched program.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Despite international pressure and Trump's military operations, Maduro has survived multiple regime-change attempts over years. The timeline to March 31, 2026 gives only ~3.5 months. Cuba offering asylum and Belarus support shows he has exit options, but authoritarian leaders rarely leave voluntarily on such short timelines. Market is overpricing his departure.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- **Market 1 (76ers -6.5)**: BET NO - 11.7% edge\n- **Market 2 (Trump Gold Cards)**: NO_TRADE - Only 7% edge\n- **Market 3 (Maduro out)**: BET NO - 16% edge (BEST VALUE)\n\nThe strongest opportunity is Market 3 betting NO on Maduro's departure, with 16% edge suggesting the market is significantly overestimating the probability of regime change in a 3.5-month window.",
