  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for the Cavaliers -14.5 spread, with most models agreeing the market underestimates their chance to cover against the weak Wizards. There is significant disagreement on the Spurs-Thunder game, with true probability estimates ranging from 70% to 93% for the Thunder, making a unified trade call unclear. For the Trump tariff dividend, models largely agree the 2025 market is overpriced given the announced 2026 timeline, but the edge on the \"No\" side is generally considered too small to recommend.",
