The selection process has been marked by several developments:\n\n- **Candidate Considerations**: In August 2025, President Trump narrowed his list of potential candidates to four individuals: Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council; Kevin Warsh, former Federal Reserve Governor; Christopher Waller, current Federal Reserve Governor; and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, Bessent expressed a preference to remain in his current role, leading to his removal from consideration.

Recent developments provide insight into the political landscape and the factors influencing this outcome.\n\n**Election Timeline and Political Climate**\n\nPrime Minister Orb\u00e1n has indicated that the elections are expected to occur at the earliest possible date, which is the second weekend of April 2026.

  "consensus_summary": "The AI responses show clear consensus for Market 3 (leaning YES on Orb\u00e1n's re-election) and Market 2 (leaning YES that Trump will *not* announce in 2025), but they are sharply divided on Market 1 regarding Alphabet's market cap rank due to conflicting data interpretations. The primary disagreement centers on whether Alphabet's reported $2.94 trillion valuation is accurate or if a cited $3.82 trillion November surge makes surpassing Apple plausible. Overall, predictions for Markets 2 and 3 are more aligned based on timeline and polling data, while Market 1 remains highly contested.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: Alphabet is currently the fourth-largest company by market cap, and with a significant gap between its market cap and that of Microsoft, catching up to become the third-largest company by the end of 2025 seems unlikely. Despite its recent growth due to AI advancements, surpassing Microsoft or Apple in such a short timeframe appears challenging.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although Trump has not yet announced his choice for the next Fed Chair, he has a preferred candidate in mind. The lack of a specific timeline for when he will make the announcement creates uncertainty. Thus, taking a position in this market seems speculative without clearer indications of his intentions.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Viktor Orb\u00e1n has a favorable public opinion with 50% of Hungarians considering him the most likely winner for the upcoming election. Given the current political climate and Orb\u00e1n's strong position in the polls, it seems probable that he will continue as the Prime Minister of Hungary.",

With only ~19 days left and Alphabet needing to close a significant gap, this seems unlikely without a major market shift.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: With less than 3 weeks remaining in 2025 and Trump still having not announced a Fed Chair despite narrowing candidates, the pattern suggests he's content waiting until closer to Powell's May 2026 term expiration. The recent trade at $783 on Yes reflects this likelihood.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Orb\u00e1n leads polls with 50% believing he'll win the April 2026 election versus 32% for his main challenger, and Fidesz maintains strong institutional control in Hungary. Despite some opposition momentum, Orb\u00e1n has won four consecutive elections and remains the clear favorite.",

His November statement about having a \"preferred candidate\" hasn't resulted in action, suggesting he'll wait until 2026.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Orb\u00e1n holds a commanding lead with 50% public support versus 32% for his main challenger P\u00e9ter Magyar, and Fidesz is actively preparing for the April 2026 elections.
