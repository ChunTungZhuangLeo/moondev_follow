  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a critical data discrepancy in Market 1, with all AIs agreeing the 78% price is likely erroneous and the true failure probability is low, but they uniformly recommend NO_TRADE due to the confusion. For Markets 2 and 3, the AIs generally agree there is no clear 10%+ edge, though one model dissented by recommending a \"YES\" trade on the Bayern game based on stronger offensive metrics. Overall, the collective analysis finds no confidently actionable trades meeting the 10% edge threshold across the three markets.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 78%\nEdge: -53%\nExpected Value: High if betting NO\nReasoning: The web search indicates Polymarket itself shows only 27% chance of bank failure, which directly contradicts the 78% market price shown. This appears to be a data discrepancy - either the market price is stale or there's an error. Current banking sector shows no imminent failure signals based on recent news about regulatory actions and new bank launches. However, given the conflicting data, I cannot confidently trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 62.2% (for Team Liquid)\nEdge: -17.2%\nExpected Value: Moderate if betting NO (Team Spirit)\nReasoning: Team Spirit has the historical edge (14-10 overall, 5-3 in past 12 months) and won their most recent matchup 1-0. However, esports matches are highly volatile and Game 2 dynamics depend on Game 1 results. The 62% price for Liquid seems slightly high given Spirit's recent form, but without knowing Game 1 outcome, edge is uncertain and I lack sufficient conviction.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 63%\nEdge: +12%\nExpected Value: +12% \u00d7 0.59 = +7.1% ROI\nReasoning: Bayern has scored 2+ goals in 21 consecutive Bundesliga matches (all-time record), won all last 8 home games vs Mainz, and Mainz has lost 6 of last 10 away games. Bayern at home is an offensive juggernaut, and Mainz's weak away defense suggests high-scoring affair. Over 3.5 goals is likely given Bayern's attacking prowess and Mainz's vulnerability.",

Recent regulatory findings on \"debanking\" don't indicate imminent failures. With strong regulatory oversight and no major stress indicators, true probability of failure by March 31 is low (~22%).
