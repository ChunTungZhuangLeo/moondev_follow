However, Everton also has players returning from suspension, making the match outcome uncertain. Without clear indicators favoring a draw or a win for either team, a no-trade decision is prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Runa Team has a better recent performance with two wins in their last five matches compared to Amaru Gaming's one win in three matches. Additionally, Runa Team is ranked 21st in the world, while Amaru Gaming is unranked, suggesting a stronger competitive edge for Runa Team in this matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although Josh Shapiro is making strategic moves that could position him for a presidential run, he has not yet declared his candidacy. His actions indicate potential intentions, but without an official announcement or stronger indicators of widespread support, the outcome remains too uncertain for a confident prediction.",
