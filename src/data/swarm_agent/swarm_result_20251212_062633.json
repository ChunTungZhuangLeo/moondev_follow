Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Tesla launches unsupervised full self driving (FSD) by December 31?\nCurrent Market Price: 95.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $566.81 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/tesla-launches-unsupervised-full-self-driving-fsd-by\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, Tesla has made significant strides toward achieving unsupervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, with plans to launch driverless robotaxis in Austin, Texas, within the next three weeks. CEO Elon Musk stated that Tesla has \"pretty much solved\" unsupervised FSD and is currently focused on validation processes. ([teslamagz.com](https://teslamagz.com/news/musk-says-unsupervised-fsd-is-pretty-much-solved/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAnalyst Alexander Potter from Piper Sandler highlighted a substantial improvement in Tesla's FSD performance, noting a more than 20-fold increase in \"miles to critical disengagement\" after the release of FSD v14.1.x in October.

The sale will offer 300 million tokens, representing 3% of the total supply, with a fully diluted valuation ranging from $100 million to $1 billion. Participants can use USDC or USDT on the Ethereum network, with a minimum bid of $100. Testnet users are eligible for priority allocation, purchase multipliers, and GPU workstation rewards.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear trade for Market 1, as most AIs find its 95% price overconfident despite Tesla's progress, leaving insufficient edge. For Market 2, opinions are split on whether the $70M commitment will be met, creating disagreement on whether a \"YES\" bet offers a sufficient edge. Regarding Market 3, all analysts agree there is no actionable trade, as the game is viewed as an unpredictable rivalry with no clear value versus the market price.",

The phrase \"pretty much solved\" and focus on \"validation processes\" suggests regulatory and technical hurdles remain. However, with only 19 days left and active deployment underway, the probability is still high - just not 95% high.

The current Polymarket volume of ~$72K doesn't directly indicate sale commitments. Reaching $70M in a few days requires massive participation that isn't guaranteed despite the hype. Market is overconfident given the sale hasn't even begun.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 69% (assuming this is Army's price)\nEdge: -7% (62% - 69%)\nExpected Value: -7% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: Army has had strong seasons recently with their triple-option offense, but Navy has historically been competitive in this rivalry. The 69% price for Army seems slightly high given the unpredictable nature of rivalry games and Navy's ability to match Army's style. However, without specific 2025 season records and recent form data, I cannot confidently establish 10%+ edge either direction.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**",

December 31 deadline is extremely tight (19 days away), and Tesla has history of missing FSD timelines. However, 95% market price already reflects significant skepticism, leaving insufficient edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 85.3%\nEdge: +6.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The public sale launches December 15 (3 days away) with 300M tokens at $100-1B FDV. Even at minimum $100M valuation, that's $3M in tokens available. Given crypto market conditions, testnet user incentives, and that Polymarket volume alone shows $72K committed, $70M threshold seems very achievable. However, edge is below 10% threshold.\n\n**DECISION: NO_TRADE** (Edge: 6.7% < 10% minimum)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 69%\nEdge: -14% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +14% \u00d7 payout = Strong positive EV on NO\nReasoning: Army enters 11-1 with strong rushing attack and #1 defense nationally. Navy is 8-3 but has struggled against quality opponents. Army is favored by Vegas spreads. The 69% Navy price appears inflated - likely due to recent $690 NO bet creating momentum. Historical rivalry dynamics don't justify Navy as 69% favorite.\n\n**DECISION: NO** (Bet on Army - 14% edge)",
