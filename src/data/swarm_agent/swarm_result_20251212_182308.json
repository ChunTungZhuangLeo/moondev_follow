  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 3 as the clearest opportunity, with all AIs agreeing its ~92.8% market price is a severe overestimate compared to their much lower true probability estimates, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Markets 1 and 2, most models see the current prices as reasonably accurate or offering only a minimal edge, leading to a majority \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation. There is notable disagreement only on the specific probability estimates for each market, but strong alignment on the final trading decisions.",

Winning by 2+ goals against the Blackhawks while missing key players is harder than the market suggests, but the edge isn't sufficient for a trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -2.8% (75% - 77.8%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 for Pipsqueak+4, but both teams have identical recent form (2-3 in last 5). Betting odds of 1.24 imply ~80% probability. The market at 77.8% is fairly priced given the ranking differential and recent inconsistent form from both teams. Single game variance in Dota 2 is high.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -67.8% (25% - 92.8%)\nExpected Value: MASSIVE value on NO side (~9.4x return on 67.8% edge)\nReasoning: This market is severely mispriced. Braunschweig is the AWAY team playing at Dresden's stadium. Betting odds show Dresden as favorites (2.10 odds = ~48% win probability) with Braunschweig having only ~25-30% chance to win. The 92.8% market price is completely disconnected from reality - this appears to be a market error or manipulation.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---",

The market is slightly overvaluing Blues despite these roster issues, but edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 74%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -3.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 Pipsqueak+4 with strong betting odds (1.24) and 97% community prediction support. However, both teams have identical 2-5 recent form, suggesting some variance. Market price accurately reflects Heroic's advantage with minimal mispricing.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 32%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -60.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive EV on NO side\nReasoning: This is an AWAY match at Dresden's stadium (Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion), not a home game for Braunschweig. Both teams are struggling (14th vs 17th place), and betting odds show Dresden at 47.6% to win with draw at 3.45 odds. The 92.8% market price appears to mistakenly assume Braunschweig is playing at home. True probability of Braunschweig winning away is approximately 32% (implied by 2.10 odds on Dresden + draw possibility).\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: BET NO on Market 3** - This represents a massive 60%+ edge due to apparent market confusion about home/away status.",
