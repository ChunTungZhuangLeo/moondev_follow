([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/wicked-good-opens-record-150-million-2025-11-23/?utm_source=openai)) This places it among the highest-grossing musical films in domestic box office history, trailing only Disney's \"The Lion King\" (2019) and \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017).\n\nIn contrast, \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" released in December 2022, had an impressive opening weekend, grossing approximately $435 million worldwide. ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWcUUh93Zb4&utm_source=openai)) While this figure is higher than \"Wicked: For Good's\" domestic opening, it is important to note that \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" had a global release, whereas \"Wicked: For Good\" has only been released in the U.S. and Canada to date.\n\nGiven the current trajectory and the strong performance of \"Wicked: For G...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' have the best domestic opening weekend in 2025?\nRecent trade: $4,120.01 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/which-movie-has-best-opening-weekend-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\n\"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" the third installment in James Cameron's \"Avatar\" franchise, is set to release on December 19, 2025.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The recent form and statistics for both teams suggest a relatively balanced match, with both teams having a decent scoring record. There is significant uncertainty around whether the total goals will exceed 2.5, evidenced by the mixed results in their recent matches. Without stronger indicators, taking a position on this market is not advisable.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: \"Wicked: For Good\" had a domestic opening weekend of $150 million, which is impressive but does not surpass the domestic opening of \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" at $435 million worldwide. While \"Wicked: For Good\" had a strong showing, the figures indicate it did not have a bigger domestic opening than \"Avatar: The Way of Water.\"\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Early projections for \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" estimate a domestic opening between $95 million and $165 million. Given that \"Wicked: For Good\" already achieved a $150 million opening, and considering the strong competition from other high-grossing films this year, it is unlikely to have the best domestic opening weekend in 2025.

      "response": "**MARKET 1: Under**\nReasoning: Both teams have shown defensive vulnerabilities, but the recent large trade on Under and Europa League knockout stage dynamics often produce tighter, more cautious matches. Panathinaikos averages 2 goals but Plze\u0148's away form in Europe tends to be more conservative.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES (Wicked)**\nReasoning: The news confirms \"Wicked: For Good\" opened to $150 million domestically, while the original \"Avatar\" (2009) had a domestic opening of approximately $77 million. The market is comparing to the original Avatar's opening, not Avatar 2, making Wicked the clear winner.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO**\nReasoning: With Avatar: Fire and Ash projected at $95-165 million opening weekend, it faces stiff competition from other 2025 releases. \"Wicked: For Good\" already opened to $150 million domestically in late 2025, and other blockbusters throughout the year likely already surpassed Avatar 3's projected range for best 2025 opening.",

However, the $840 recent trade on Under suggests sharp money disagrees, and Europa League matches can be tactical. Insufficient edge to confidently predict either side of 2.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The context appears confused - it references \"Wicked: For Good\" opening at $150M in 2025, but this seems to conflate \"Wicked\" (2024) with its sequel. Avatar: The Way of Water opened to $134M domestic in 2022. Without clear data on what \"Avatar\" film is being compared (original had $77M opening, Way of Water had $134M), this market lacks clarity for a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Avatar: Fire and Ash's projected $95-165M opening in late December faces strong 2025 competition. The recent $4,120 trade on No suggests informed money believes other 2025 releases (likely major superhero films or established franchises releasing earlier in peak summer season) will outperform. December releases, while profitable long-term, rarely achieve the absolute highest opening weekends.",
