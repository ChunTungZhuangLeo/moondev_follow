An away win is unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the last head-to-head was a 1-1 draw and both teams have mixed form, draws are inherently difficult to predict.

Playing away at Dinamo Zagreb (who are undefeated in 87% of their last 15 home matches and won 67% of them) makes this a difficult fixture for a weakened Betis side.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Dinamo Zagreb's strong home record (undefeated in 87% of last 15 home matches, winning 67%) suggests they're likely to push for a win rather than settle for a draw. The recent $794 bet on No aligns with this assessment, as home advantage typically leads to decisive results rather than draws.",
