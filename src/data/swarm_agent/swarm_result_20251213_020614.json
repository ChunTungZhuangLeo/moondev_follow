Morant is listed as questionable for the upcoming game. The team's recent success is largely attributed to their 2024 draft picks: Zach Edey, Jaylen Wells, and Cam Spencer. Wells has been particularly impactful, averaging 16.7 points over the last nine games.

The highest risk is Netanyahu (ongoing war, potential political shifts) or Khamenei (age 85+, health concerns), but neither has imminent departure signals.

With Morant potentially returning, pace could increase. However, 233.5 is a high total and 89% seems slightly overpriced for the over. The market has largely priced in the scoring trends correctly.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -21% (35% - 56%)\nExpected Value: +37.5% potential return on NO bet (21% edge / 44% NO price)\nReasoning: The market shows 56% for Jazz 1H Moneyline, but Memphis is significantly better (7-2 recent record), playing at home, and the Jazz are a rebuilding team focused on rookie development. Even without Morant, the Grizzlies should be favored at home in the first half. This appears to be a significant mispricing - Memphis should be closer to 65% favorites for 1H.",

However, Netanyahu faces ongoing political pressure and potential coalition instability, and Maduro's Venezuela remains volatile. The 91% market price already reflects the high probability these leaders survive through year-end, leaving insufficient edge for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 89%\nEdge: -11% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$0.11 per $1 risked\nReasoning: The 233.5 total is elevated. Memphis has strong defense and is playing without Morant (questionable status). Utah is focused on rookie development and struggling offensively. Recent Jazz games have trended under, and Memphis's wins have come with disciplined defense. Market is overpricing the Over - this is a NO (Under) bet.\n\n**CORRECTION: Decision should be NO (bet Under)**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -4% (Your prob - Market)\nReasoning: Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games and dominates first halves at home. However, the recent large bet on Jazz ($1,130) suggests sharp money sees value. Morant's questionable status adds uncertainty. The 56% price on Jazz winning first half seems fairly efficient given the uncertainty, with insufficient edge to justify a position.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n- **Market 1**: NO_TRADE (insufficient edge, market fairly priced)\n- **Market 2**: **NO (BET UNDER)** - Market overvalues Over at 89%, true probability ~78%\n- **Market 3**: NO_TRADE (line appears efficient given circumstances)\n\n**Recommended Action**: Only Market 2 presents tradeable edge, betting NO (Under 233.5 points) with 11% negative edge on the Over side.",
