Given Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza/Lebanon and historical pattern of cross-border strikes (Syria, Yemen, etc.), it's highly likely they've already conducted or will conduct at least one strike this month.

However, Middle East volatility and recent West Bank settlement announcements create uncertainty. Edge is exactly at threshold but lack of strong conviction suggests NO_TRADE.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 80.0%\nEdge: +5.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: T1 has won 4 of last 5 matches with strong recent form including a 3-1 victory over BNK FEARX. They hold a 22-17 historical edge over Dplus KIA. However, the 5% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: NO TRADES**\nNone of these markets offer sufficient edge (10%+) to justify a trade at this time. Market 2 comes closest with -10.8% edge favoring NO, but the geopolitical uncertainty and exactly 10% threshold without strong conviction makes it marginal.",
