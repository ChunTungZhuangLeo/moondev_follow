The likelihood of the stock dropping to $145 by 2026 appears low given the strong growth predictions.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid has a strong home record, averaging 2.5 goals per game, and has historically performed well against Valencia, including a 3-0 victory earlier in the year. Valencia's poor away form further supports the likelihood of more than 1.5 goals in the match.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams are struggling, and while there is potential for goals, the inconsistency in both teams' performances makes it difficult to confidently predict over or under 2.5 goals.
