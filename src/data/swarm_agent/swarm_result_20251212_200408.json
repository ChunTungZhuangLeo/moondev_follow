  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's \"Under\" as the strongest opportunity, with most AIs agreeing the market's ~77% price for \"Over\" is significantly overvalued against a true probability near 70-71%. For Markets 2 and 3, the AIs uniformly advise against trading due to either a lack of informational edge or because the market price already reflects the available data. There is notable disagreement only on the specific edge calculation for Market 1, but unanimous agreement on its directional mispricing.",

Lecce averages 0.71 goals at home, Pisa 0.77 away - combined expectation under 1.5 goals. Both teams fighting relegation typically play defensively. The market at 77.1% for Over is wildly mispriced.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Bet UNDER 2.5 goals)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: O/U 243.5**\n\nYour Probability: 48% (Over 243.5)\nMarket Price: 51.0% (Over 243.5)\nEdge: -3%\nExpected Value: Minimal edge, not actionable\n\nReasoning: No specific news context available.

However, the market at 77.1% has already priced this in accurately. The recent $4,545 trade on Under confirms market sentiment aligns with fundamentals.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market is efficiently priced; insufficient edge to justify a position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Jazz vs. Grizzlies: O/U 243.5**\n\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 51.0%\nEdge: -3.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal negative\nReasoning: No recent news context available, and 243.5 is an extremely high total for NBA (typical range is 215-235). The market appears near 50/50, suggesting uncertainty. The recent $2,000 Under trade indicates some bearish sentiment, but without team news, injury reports, or pace data, this is essentially a coin flip.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Insufficient information and edge below 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**1.

The market at 89% undervalues the strong statistical case for a low-scoring match.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - While edge is +8%, it falls just short of the required 10% minimum threshold for trade execution. This is a borderline case where slight additional conviction would warrant a YES position on Under.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** No trades meet the strict 10%+ edge requirement. Market 3 comes closest with 8% edge favoring Under, but discipline requires waiting for clearer opportunities. Markets 1 and 2 are efficiently priced or lack sufficient information.",
