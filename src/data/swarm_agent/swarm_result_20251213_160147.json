A bet on the \"Over\" wins if the fight extends beyond 3.5 rounds, while a bet on the \"Under\" wins if the fight concludes before reaching 3.5 rounds.

However, understanding the dynamics of this market is crucial for bettors. Factors such as the fighters' historical performance, fighting styles, and the nature of the matchup can influence the expected duration of a fight. For instance, bouts between aggressive fighters with knockout power may be more likely to end quickly, making the \"Under\" a potentially favorable bet.\n\nIt's als\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Spread: Illinois Fighting Illini (-10.5)\nCurrent Market Price: 58.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $3,500.00 on Illinois Fighting Illini\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/cbb-nebr-ill-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe Illinois Fighting Illini are set to face the Nebraska Cornhuskers today, December 13, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET at the State Farm Center in Champaign, Illinois.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no actionable trades, as all three AI models agree Market 1 lacks specific information for a high-conviction edge and unanimously identify Markets 2 and 3 as having negative expected value. They notably agree that the market prices for Illinois covering the spread and for Horth winning by KO/TKO are overvalued relative to their true probability estimates. The collective analysis recommends against any trade, as no model identified an opportunity with a 10% or greater positive edge.",

Given no new information skewing the fight towards an early finish, the probability of the fight lasting over 3.5 rounds is slightly higher, but not enough to justify a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 45%  \nMarket Price: 58.2%  \nEdge: -13.2% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -13.2% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Illinois's recent performance and Nebraska's undefeated status suggest a closer game than the spread implies. Given Nebraska's strong form, the probability that Illinois covers a 10.5-point spread is lower, providing a good opportunity to bet against the spread.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 80%  \nMarket Price: 93.0%  \nEdge: -13% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -13% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite Horth's capability for KOs, her past performances show a mixed record of decisions and stoppages, making a KO/TKO outcome less certain than the market suggests.
