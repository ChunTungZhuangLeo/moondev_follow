The recent $660 Yes bet doesn't provide enough edge given the uncertainty.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite Russian commanders claiming capture and Putin's congratulations, Ukrainian military firmly denies these claims and states Siversk remains under their control with ongoing defense operations. With only 11 days until December 22 and conflicting reports suggesting the town hasn't definitively fallen, capture by the deadline is unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Memphis averages 116 PPG over last 10 games and just scored 119 in their recent victory. Utah has been competitive offensively this season. Both teams' recent scoring trends and the Grizzlies' strong home offense suggest the total should exceed 233.5 points, aligning with the recent $667 Over bet.",
