However, recent developments suggest a potential escalation in Israeli military activities in the region.\n\n**Recent Military Actions:**\n\n- **December 9, 2025:** The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted airstrikes targeting 13 locations in southern Lebanon, including training compounds and rocket-launch sites allegedly operated by Hezbollah. ([english.palinfo.com](https://english.palinfo.com/news/2025/12/09/353290/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **December 1\u20137, 2025:** The IDF carried out multiple operations against Hezbollah targets, focusing on weapons caches and military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

In mid-October 2025, OpenAI stated that GPT-6 would not ship this year, indicating a deliberate development pace. ([bearyangry.com](https://bearyangry.com/2025/10/18/openai-confirms-gpt%E2%80%916-is-not-shipping-in-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe company's recent focus has been on enhancing the GPT-5 series. On December 11, 2025, OpenAI launched GPT-5.2, following a \"code red\" directive from CEO Sam Altman to accelerate development in response to competition from Google's Gemini 3. GPT-5.2 offers improved general intelligence, coding capabilities, and long-context understanding. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-launches-gpt-52-ai-model-with-improved-capabilities-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAnalysts have projected that GPT-6's public deployment is likely \"at least months away,\" with expectations pointing toward late 2026 or early 2027.

([realmadrid.com](https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US/football/games/la-liga/alaves-real-madrid/14-12-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **Managerial Pressure:** Xabi Alonso, appointed as head coach in June 2025, is under increasing scrutiny due to recent poor results. The team has secured only two wins in their last eight matches across all competitions, including a 2-0 league loss to Celta Vigo and a Champions League defeat to Manchester City. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/alonso-under-pressure-real-prepare-critical-trip-alaves-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Internal Tensions:** Reports suggest internal conflicts between Alonso and key players like Federico Valverde and Vin\u00edcius Jr., which have further complicated the team's dynamics.

This statement, along with their focus on GPT-5 series updates, makes it highly unlikely that GPT-6 will be released this year.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Real Madrid is currently underperforming, with managerial pressure on Xabi Alonso and internal tensions affecting team dynamics. Their recent poor form, including losses in key matches, suggests they may struggle against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s.",

This is essentially a certainty for NO.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Despite Real Madrid being favorites against Alav\u00e9s, their recent poor form (only 2 wins in 8 matches), managerial pressure on Xabi Alonso, and reported internal conflicts create significant uncertainty that makes this match less predictable than the odds might suggest.",

Without real-time confirmation of strikes today, this is too uncertain to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: OpenAI has officially confirmed GPT-6 will not ship in 2025, with the company just releasing GPT-5.2 on December 11. Analysts project GPT-6 deployment is \"at least months away\" pointing to late 2026 or early 2027, making a December 31 release virtually impossible.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Real Madrid has won only 2 of their last 8 matches, manager Xabi Alonso is under severe pressure following losses to Celta Vigo and Manchester City, and there are reported internal conflicts with key players.
