Recent analyses suggest that both teams are likely to score in this Championship fixture.\n\n**Recent Form and Head-to-Head:**\n\n- Leicester City has been inconsistent, with three wins, one draw, and two losses in their last six matches. ([forebet.com](https://www.forebet.com/en/football-match-previews/24521-leicester-city-seek-home-response-as-ipswich-town-target-top-three-push?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Ipswich Town is on an upward trajectory, remaining unbeaten in their past three games and winning two of them. ([ca.sports.yahoo.com](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/pick-stats-leicester-city-v-134938558.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Historically, Leicester is unbeaten in their last six league games against Ipswich (three wins and three draws) since a 1-0 defeat in March 2013.

([americanwx.com](https://www.americanwx.com/bb/topic/62392-december-2025-obs-and-discussion/page/32/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHistorically, December 13 has seen temperatures ranging from lows around 29\u00b0F to highs near 66\u00b0F. ([newsmobile.in](https://www.newsmobile.in/world/new-york-warm-winter-weather-sets-record/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn recent years, December temperatures in New York City have varied. For instance, December 2015 was notably warm, with an average temperature of 50.1\u00b0F, significantly above the 1901-2000 average. ([stacker.com](https://stacker.com/stories/new-york/kings-county-ny/warmest-decembers-kings-county-new-york-history?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the current forecast and historical data, it's unlikely that the highest temperature in New York City on December 13, 2025, will fall between 42-43\u00b0F. \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Dota 2: Heroic vs Aurora - Game 1 Winner\nCurrent Market Price: 52.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $2,000.00 on Heroic\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/dota2-heroic-aur1-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nIn the most recent match between Heroic and Aurora Gaming, held on November 7, 2025, during the BLAST Slam IV tournament, Heroic secured a 2-0 victory over Aurora Gaming.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no trade for Market 1 due to its extreme price, unanimously recommends a \"NO\" trade for Market 2 as the temperature range is overpriced, and is split on Market 3, with a slight lean toward \"YES\" but insufficient edge agreement for a strong recommendation. The primary disagreement centers on whether Market 3 offers a meaningful edge, while all models agree Market 2 presents a clear opportunity. Overall, only Market 2 meets the 10%+ edge threshold for a recommended trade.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -40.9%\nExpected Value: High on NO side\nReasoning: The 95.9% price for BTTS seems extremely high. Championship matches typically see BTTS in roughly 50-60% of games. While both teams can score, Leicester's inconsistent form and historical head-to-head showing tight games (including 1-0 results) suggests this is massively overpriced. However, this price is so extreme it may indicate the match has already been played or there's information I'm missing - recommending caution.\n\n**Wait - re-reading this market, the 95.9% price with a $958.60 recent trade on Yes suggests this match may have already occurred or is in-play. Given the extreme price, I'll mark NO_TRADE due to uncertainty about market status.**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -71%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The forecast says \"lower 40s\u00b0F\" which is a range (40-44\u00b0F roughly), but hitting exactly 42-43\u00b0F is a very narrow 2-degree window. Even if the forecast center is around 42-43, weather variability means the actual high could easily be 41\u00b0F or 44\u00b0F. A 2-degree window historically has maybe 15-20% probability at best. The recent $562.84 NO trade suggests smart money agrees this is overpriced.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: +13%\nExpected Value: +13% \u00d7 0.92 = +12% EV\nReasoning: Heroic dominated Aurora 2-0 in their most recent meeting (November 7, 2025), with Game 1 being a complete stomp (31-4 kills, finished in 33 minutes). This demonstrates clear skill differential. The $2,000 recent trade on Heroic suggests informed money is backing them. At 52% implied odds, there's value on Heroic given their dominant head-to-head performance.",

However, Leicester's home inconsistency and defensive vulnerabilities make BTTS likely around 90-92%.

The probability of hitting exactly the narrow 42-43\u00b0F band is much lower than 86%.

This suggests slight Heroic favoritism, but the 3% edge is insufficient for a confident trade given the variance in individual Dota 2 games and potential roster/meta changes since November.\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADES:**\n- **Market 2: BET NO** (21% edge - market significantly overpricing the narrow temperature band)",
