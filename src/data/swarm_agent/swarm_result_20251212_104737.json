As of December 12, 2025, the prediction market on Polymarket indicates a 40% probability that Lighter's Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) will exceed $3 billion one day after its launch.

([bitgetapp.com](https://www.bitgetapp.com/news/detail/12560605058794?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, the platform recorded a 72% probability that the FDV would exceed $1 billion on the day after launch. ([bitget.site](https://www.bitget.site/en/amp/news/detail/12560605100742?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese predictions reflect growing confidence in Lighter's potential, especially considering its recent $68 million\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?\nCurrent Market Price: 95.9% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $757.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2028\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2028 U.S. Presidential Election. In a July 2025 interview, he expressed support for Vice President J.D. Vance, stating, \"I think J.D. Vance would be a great nominee.\" ([aol.com](https://www.aol.com/rubio-2028-election-think-jd-143236894.html?utm_source=openai)) Rubio also acknowledged Vance as the leading contender for the Republican nomination, expressing his intention to support Vance if he chooses to run.

Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be \"unstoppable\" in the 2028 presidential elections, indicating potential support for this combination.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge to bet against Marco Rubio winning in 2028, with most AIs agreeing the 95.9% market price is vastly overvalued given his non-candidacy. For the Lighter market, opinions are split between seeing a buying opportunity and viewing the price as efficient, resulting in no clear trade. Regarding the soccer match, estimates of Angers' true probability vary widely, leading to conflicting trade recommendations and no consensus.",

While Angers has decent home form (3 wins in 7) and Nantes is struggling, home wins in Ligue 1 between mid-table teams rarely exceed 45%. The market at 55% significantly overprices Angers' chances.\n\n**However, I need to reconsider the NO bet:**\nIf true probability is 42%, then NO probability is 58% vs market NO at 45%. Edge on NO = +13%.\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability (for NO): 58%\nMarket Price (for NO): 45%\nEdge: +13%\nExpected Value: +13% \u00d7 2.22 = +28.9%\nReasoning: Traditional bookmaker odds of 2.41 imply only ~41% win probability for Angers. Nantes' poor form helps Angers but not enough to justify 55%.

The probability decline from 68% to current levels suggests market is pricing in uncertainty appropriately. Edge insufficient.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -90.9%\nExpected Value: Massive (betting NO)\nReasoning: This appears to be a serious market error. Rubio has explicitly stated he supports JD Vance for 2028 and hasn't declared candidacy. Vance, as sitting VP, would be the natural frontrunner. A 95.9% probability for Rubio is absurd - this should be closer to 5-10%. Strong NO bet.",

However, this is Ligue 1 where upsets are common and both teams are mid-table. The 55% market price seems fairly accurate for a home favorite against poor form visitors. Not enough edge to justify a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -4.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: The market probability has actually DROPPED from 68% in November to 49.9% now, suggesting cooling enthusiasm. Lighter raised $68M which is solid but not massive. Achieving $3B FDV requires extreme hype on launch day. Recent crypto launches have been more subdued.

Rubio explicitly endorsed J.D. Vance for 2028 and called him \"the leading contender.\" Trump suggested a Vance-Rubio ticket (with Vance at top). There's zero indication Rubio will run for PRESIDENT in 2028. The 95.9% price appears to be a data error or confusion - this should be under 10%. **STRONG NO RECOMMENDATION - this is likely the wrong Marco Rubio or market description error.**\n\n**CRITICAL NOTE ON MARKET 3:** The 95.9% price makes no logical sense given the context. Either:\n1. The market title is wrong (maybe asking if he'll be VP candidate?)\n2. There's confusion with a different person\n3. This is a severe mispricing opportunity\n\nThe NO side offers exceptional value at these odds.",
