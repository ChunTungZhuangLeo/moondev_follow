  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Valencia winning is highly improbable, with all models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to the massive edge against the market's 92% price. For the Heisman market, opinions vary on the exact probability, leading to a split between a \"NO\" trade and \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient edge. There is clear disagreement on the Arsenal match, with one model identifying a strong \"YES\" edge for Over 2.5 goals while another sees no actionable opportunity.",
