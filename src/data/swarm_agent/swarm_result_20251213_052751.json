  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 1400+ tweets in December 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 63.6% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $750.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Elon Musk's Twitter activity has been notably high, with recent data indicating an average of nearly 100 tweets per day. ([statswithsasa.com](https://www.statswithsasa.com/2025/02/12/elon-musk-twitter-habits/?utm_source=openai)) This consistent posting rate suggests that he is on track to exceed 1,400 tweets by the end of December 2025.\n\nPrediction markets reflect this expectation. For instance, a market on Polymarket regarding Musk's tweet count from December 12 to December 19, 2025, shows a 4.2% chance of him posting between 160 and 179 tweets during that period. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19-160-179?utm_source=openai)) Extrapolating from this, it's reasonable to anticipate that Musk will surpass 1,400 tweets in December 2025.\n\nIn summary, current data and market analyses indicate a strong likelihood that Elon Musk will post over 1,400 tweets in December 2025. \n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: TikTok sale announced in 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.5% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $7,459.32 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/tiktok-sale-announced-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nIn 2025, TikTok's sale process has been marked by several key developments:\n\n**Regulatory Actions and Deadlines:**\n- In April 2025, President Donald Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to divest its U.S. operations by 75 days, citing progress in negotiations. ([aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/4/trump-again-extends-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-to-avoid-us-ban?utm_source=openai))\n- By June 2025, the deadline was extended again by 90 days, with Trump expressing a desire to \"save TikTok\" and noting \"tremendous progress\" in the process. ([english.ahram.org.eg](https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/548298.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Potential Buyers and Offers:**\n- In April 2025, Amazon made a bid to acquire TikTok, though it was reported that some participants in the discussions did not take Amazon's offer seriously. ([macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/amazon-tiktok-offer/?utm_source=openai))\n- Walmart was also considering a bid for TikTok, as reported in A\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Dota 2: OG vs Team Spirit (BO3)\nCurrent Market Price: 65.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $609.30 on Team Spirit\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/dota2-og-ts8-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nOG and Team Spirit are set to face off in a Best of 3 series on December 13, 2025, at 11:00 AM UTC, as part of the ESL Dota2 2025 DreamLeague Season 27 Main Event Group Stage \u2013 Round 4. ([strafe.com](https://www.strafe.com/match/og-vs-team-spirit-round-4-main-event-2e7511/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Team Form:**\n\n- **OG:** Over the past month, OG has maintained a 61% win rate, including notable victories against BetBoom (2-0) and HEROIC (2-0). However, their overall season win rate stands at 44%, indicating some inconsistency. ([bo3.gg](https://bo3.gg/dota2/matches/og-dota2-vs-team-spirit-13-12-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Team Spirit:** In contrast, Team Spirit boasts a 90% win rate in the last month, with a strong 70% win rate over the past six months. Their head-to-head record against OG is also favorable, with a 63% win rate. ([bo3.gg](https://bo3.gg/dota2/matches/og-dota2-vs-team-spirit-13-12-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Betting Odds:**\n\nBookmakers favor Team Spirit, with odds around \n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1 (Elon Musk tweets) presents a significant positive edge for \"YES,\" with most models estimating a true probability between 78-95% versus a 63.6% market price. For Market 2 (TikTok sale), there is notable disagreement on the exact probability but clear agreement that the \"NO\" side is undervalued against an overconfident 97.5% market price. Regarding Market 3 (Dota 2), the models show mixed signals, leading to a lack of clear trading consensus as the edge calculations vary and often fall below the 10% threshold.",

With consistent daily activity and strong market indicators pointing towards him surpassing this number, the probability of this happening is significantly higher than the market price suggests.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 95%  \nMarket Price: 97.5%  \nEdge: -2.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -2.5%  \nReasoning: Although there are regulatory pressures and potential buyers, the extended deadlines and lack of a concrete sale announcement reduce the certainty.

At this pace, he needs only ~100 more tweets over 18 remaining days, which is virtually certain given his consistent posting habits.\n\n**Decision: YES**\n\n---\n\nMARKET 2: TikTok sale announced in 2025?\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -52.5%\nExpected Value: 52.5% \u00d7 0.026 = +1.4% (betting NO)\nReasoning: Despite multiple deadline extensions and \"progress\" claims, no actual sale has been announced. The pattern of extensions without concrete deals suggests negotiations are stalling. ByteDance has shown reluctance to sell, and the definition of \"sale announced\" may require more than just negotiations.

However, we're already halfway through December (Dec 13), so need to verify current count. The 6.4% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold for a trade recommendation.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -12.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High (12.5% edge on NO side)\nReasoning: While there's been regulatory activity and buyer interest, NO actual sale has been ANNOUNCED yet as of the context date. Multiple deadline extensions suggest delays, not imminent announcement. Market is significantly overpricing YES - this is a strong NO bet with the sale likely extending into 2026 negotiations.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 65.0%\nEdge: -30% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Exceptional (30% edge on NO/Team Spirit side)\nReasoning: Team Spirit has 90% win rate last month vs OG's 61%, plus 70% season win rate vs OG's 44%, and favorable 63% head-to-head record. Market is pricing OG at 65% to win, but all data points to Team Spirit being the stronger team. This represents betting ON Team Spirit (the NO side of \"OG wins\"), which offers massive 30% edge.\n\n**CLARIFICATION ON MARKET 3:** The 65% market price appears to be for OG winning. Betting NO means betting on Team Spirit, which the data strongly supports.",
