Detroit has been resting and may come out rusty. Both teams can score, but 233.5 is a high line. The edge is too small to justify a position given the variance in NBA totals.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Counter-Strike: BIG vs Sangal (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 48%\nEdge: +14%\nExpected Value: 14% \u00d7 1.08 = 0.15\nReasoning: BIG is a significantly stronger organization with more experienced players (tabseN, JDC). They hold a 2-1 head-to-head advantage against Sangal. Both teams have identical 3-2 recent records, but BIG has superior firepower and tactical depth in a BO3 format.

The ceasefire is fragile and \"strikes\" can include minor incidents. The market is pricing this reasonably given the ongoing low-level military activity. Insufficient edge to bet NO, and the YES side doesn't offer value either.",

Hawks ended losing streak but face tough road test. Total seems fairly priced around 233-234 points.
