As a compromise, the U.S. has proposed the establishment of a \"free economic zone\" in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donbas, which Russia wants Ukraine to cede. Zelenskyy indicated this area could be demilitarized but said governance remains unclear, and any territorial concessions would require a public referendum.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds Market 1's 94% price a severe overvaluation, with most AIs assigning a much lower true probability for a 2025 announcement, though they disagree on whether it's tradeable. For Market 2, analyses generally agree the price overstates Forest's chance of winning against Tottenham, but the edge is often near or below the 10% trade threshold. On Market 3, there is notable disagreement, with some seeing a clear edge on \"YES\" due to diplomatic progress while others advise caution, preventing a strong consensus.",

Tyler McVicker confirms game is in final development stages. However, with only ~19 days left in 2025 and no official announcement yet, there's slight uncertainty.

Forest is playing Tottenham at home. While Forest has been strong this season (currently 3rd in EPL), Spurs are also competitive. Betting odds showing draw at 3.44 suggests roughly 29% draw probability, and typical home win odds around 40-45% for this matchup. 63% for a Forest win is significantly overpriced.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Market is overvaluing Forest's win probability by ~18%.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Russia x Ukraine ceasefire by end of 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 50%\nEdge: -2%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Active diplomatic negotiations are occurring with US involvement and concrete proposals on the table. However, major sticking points remain (territorial concessions, Donbas governance, referendum requirements). With 12+ months remaining and both sides still far apart on key issues, this is genuinely a coin flip.

The question asks for announcement \"before 2026\" (meaning by Dec 31, 2025) - only 19 days away. Even if insiders are correct about Spring 2026 release, announcement would likely come in early 2026, not the next 2.5 weeks. Market is severely overpriced but liquidity/resolution timing makes this untradeable.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 63.0%\nEdge: -8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Slightly negative but below threshold\nReasoning: Nottingham Forest has been in excellent form under their manager with 6 wins in 11 matches, but Tottenham remains a superior squad on paper despite inconsistency. Playing away at Spurs is challenging. Betting markets suggest a close match (draw at 3.44 odds = ~29% probability). Forest's 55% win probability is reasonable but only 8% below market - insufficient edge for trade recommendation.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +18% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+18% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Multiple concrete developments point toward ceasefire momentum: (1) Ukraine submitted revised 20-point peace framework to U.S., (2) U.S. proposed specific compromise on Donbas \"free economic zone\", (3) Ukraine agreed to demilitarized zone concept, (4) Trump administration incoming with stated priority to end war quickly, (5) 13+ months remain until end of 2026 deadline. While full peace treaty unlikely, a temporary ceasefire/frozen conflict becomes increasingly probable as negotiations progress and war fatigue intensifies. Market at 50% significantly undervalues these concrete diplomatic steps.",
