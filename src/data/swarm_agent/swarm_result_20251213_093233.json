  "consensus_summary": "The consensus across all three AI models is that the current market prices are overestimating the true probabilities for all three events, with no model identifying a trade with a 10%+ positive edge. There is notable agreement that Liverpool's internal tensions and Melbourne Victory's poor form justify \"NO\" positions, while assessments of the NHL game vary from a close \"NO_TRADE\" to a firm \"NO.\" Overall, the synthesized view finds no recommended trades, as each market's implied odds appear inflated compared to the analysts' collective probability estimates.",
