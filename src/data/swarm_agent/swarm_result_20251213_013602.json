  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1's \"Yes\" price at 91% is overvalued, with most analysts assigning a lower true probability (75-95%) but only one recommends a \"NO\" trade due to insufficient edge. For Market 2, all analysts agree the 89% price for the Over is severely mispriced, recommending a \"NO/Under\" bet as the clear trade with a large perceived edge. Regarding Market 3, opinions are split on the first-half moneyline, resulting in no clear trading consensus.",

Khamenei's advanced age (85+) and Netanyahu's ongoing political/legal pressures create tail risks. However, the edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: O/U 233.5**\n\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 89%\nEdge: -37% (52% - 89%)\nExpected Value: Very high positive EV on NO (Under)\n\nReasoning: 89% for the Over is extremely mispriced. The Grizzlies play at a moderate pace and have strong defense. Utah is 8-15 and struggles offensively. Ja Morant questionable could slow Memphis's tempo. NBA totals typically hover around 50-55% probability for either side. The market appears to have momentum-chased recent Over bets without fundamental justification.\n\n**Decision: NO (bet Under)**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline**\n\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: +6% (62% - 56%)\nExpected Value: Moderate but below threshold\n\nReasoning: Memphis (56% implied for 1H win) seems slightly underpriced given they're 7-2 in last 9 games, playing at home, and Morant may return.

Netanyahu faces ongoing political instability and potential coalition collapse in Israel. Putin's health rumors persist. Maduro faces international pressure. The market is overconfident that ALL seven leaders survive - even a 5% chance per leader compounds to meaningful risk. The 91% price assumes ~98.7% survival rate per leader, which seems optimistic given geopolitical volatility.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: O/U 233.5\n\n**Your Probability:** 65%\n**Market Price:** 89%\n**Edge:** -24% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong negative (bet UNDER)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** The 233.5 total is extremely high. Memphis is 7-2 in last 9 games WITHOUT Ja Morant, suggesting stronger defense. Jazz are 8-15 and struggling offensively. Even if Morant returns (questionable), both teams have incentive to control pace. The market is overvaluing the OVER at 89% - historical data shows totals this high hit around 60-65% in similar matchups. This is a clear UNDER bet.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline\n\n**Your Probability:** 35%\n**Market Price:** 56%\n**Edge:** -21% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Negative (bet Grizzlies 1H)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** The market shows 56% probability for Jazz to win first half, but this seems mispriced. Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games and plays at home. Even without Morant, their rookies (Wells averaging 16.7 PPG) have stepped up. Jazz are 8-15 and on the road. Memphis should be favored in the first half at home. The recent $1,130 bet on Jazz appears to be creating inefficiency - fade this action and take Grizzlies 1H.",
