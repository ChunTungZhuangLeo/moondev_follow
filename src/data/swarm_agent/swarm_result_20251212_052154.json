Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for increased determination and team effort to break the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets have lost three of their last four games, including a 115-106 defeat to the Denver Nuggets. Coach Charles Lee noted the benefit of rest following a busy stretch of six games in ten days.

([wargamer.com](https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/kabuto-king-first-edition-collection-prices?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis surge has garnered widespread attention, with major retailers like GameStop offering Kabuto King first access to any PSA-graded Kabuto cards traded in. ([cllct.com](https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/sports-cards/kabuto-king-looks-to-corner-market-on-common-pokemon-card?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card for charity, raising $51,100 for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

The most recent rate adjustment occurred in December 2025, when the Fed reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%. This decision was accompanied by projections indicating only one additional 25 bps cut in 2026, maintaining the outlook from September 2025. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/brokerages-stick-with-us-rate-cut-forecasts-despite-fed-caution-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite the Fed's cautious stance, several major financial institutions continue to anticipate further rate cuts in 2026. Goldman Sachs, for instance, forecasts that the Fed will pause its cutting cycle in January 2026, followed by cuts in March and June, bringing the funds rate down to a terminal level of 3%\u20133.25%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that the Bulls market price is overvalued, with most AIs estimating a true win probability below 50% versus the market's 58%. For the Kabuto card, opinions are sharply split between seeing a speculative opportunity (YES) and an overhyped bubble (NO), indicating high uncertainty. There is clear, unanimous agreement that the Fed rate cut market is overpriced at 81%, with all AIs assigning a significantly lower true probability.",

Playing on the road against a Hornets team that's had rest after a busy stretch, the Bulls' momentum is terrible. The market seems to overvalue Chicago here despite their poor form and road disadvantage.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -15%\nExpected Value: 15% \u00d7 1.67 = 25% potential return on NO bet\nReasoning: The card went from under $1 to ~$37, which is impressive, but reaching $100 requires nearly a 3x increase in just ~19 days remaining. The \"Kabuto King\" manipulation has driven prices artificially, but sustaining momentum to $100 in this timeframe is unlikely without continued massive buying.

The Fed just cut in December and projections show only one additional cut in all of 2026. An 81% probability of a January cut directly contradicts expert forecasts of a pause.

Home court advantage favors Charlotte. However, edge isn't sufficient (only 6%) to justify a NO bet given variance in NBA games.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto 1st Edition Card Hit $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability:** 15%\n**Market Price:** 40%\n**Edge:** -25% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive on NO side\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Card currently at $37 after artificial price manipulation by one collector. To reach $100 (2.7x increase) in just 19 days would require continued irrational buying with no fundamental value driver. The \"Kabuto King\" phenomenon appears to have peaked with the charity auction. Market severely overpricing the probability of such extreme short-term appreciation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed 25bps Cut in January 2026\n**Your Probability:** 8%\n**Market Price:** 81%\n**Edge:** -73% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Extremely strong positive on NO side\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Fed just cut 25bps in December 2025 to 3.5-3.75% and explicitly projected only ONE additional cut for all of 2026. Goldman Sachs forecasts Fed will PAUSE in January, then cut in March/June. The market is dramatically overpricing a January cut when Fed guidance and major institutions point to a pause.
