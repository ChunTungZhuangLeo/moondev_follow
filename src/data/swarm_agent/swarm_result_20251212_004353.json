      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: \"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\" has shown significant momentum with multiple major accolades, including tying for the most wins at the Golden Joystick Awards and receiving a record-breaking number of nominations at The Game Awards. Its strong critical reception and industry recognition position it as a likely contender for the 2025 Steam Awards' Game of the Year.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Current projections and reports indicate that tariff revenue for 2025 is expected to exceed $250 billion, with estimates ranging from $300 billion to over $400 billion. This suggests that the likelihood of tariffs generating less than $250 billion is very low.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both the Lions and Rams have demonstrated strong recent performances, with the Lions defeating the Cowboys and the Rams winning against the Cardinals. The Rams have a slightly better record, but the outcome is uncertain given the Lions' recent form. Therefore, taking a position is not advisable.",

The $250 billion threshold appears highly likely to be surpassed given these figures.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite the Rams' better record (10-3 vs 8-5), this is a competitive matchup with the Lions playing strong offensive football (44-30 win over Dallas). The recent $1,388 trade on Rams suggests value may be on the Lions side, but the Rams at home with momentum make this too close to call confidently - leaning NO (Lions) given potential value.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While \"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\" has impressive industry accolades, the Steam Awards are determined by Steam community voting, which often differs significantly from critic/industry awards. The $900 Yes bet suggests insider confidence, but without knowing the full field of competitors or Steam-specific popularity metrics, this is too uncertain.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Multiple sources confirm tariff collections already hit $150 billion by July 2025, with projections of $300-400+ billion for the full year. With half a year remaining after July and momentum continuing, exceeding $250 billion is highly likely. The recent $752 No bet appears misinformed given the data.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The Rams have a superior 10-3 record versus Lions' 8-5 and home field advantage at SoFi Stadium. However, both teams are performing well offensively, and the recent $1,388 Rams bet suggests sharp money agrees. Without seeing the exact betting lines/odds on Polymarket, it's unclear if there's value remaining.",
