  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly favors the Over (YES) in Market 2 due to the Kings' poor defense and the Nuggets' high-powered offense. For Markets 1 and 3, opinions are split between favoring the Pistons and Hawks and between favoring IU Indy and Green Bay, respectively, with several analysts recommending no trade due to insufficient edge. Overall, the clearest agreement is on the high-scoring nature of the Nuggets vs. Kings game.",

However, the Pistons lead the season series 2-0, making this a toss-up - I'll lean Hawks based on recent form.\n\nMARKET 2: Over\nReasoning: The Kings' defense has been atrocious, allowing 126 points per game recently, while both teams have strong offensive capabilities. With Denver's high-powered offense led by Joki\u0107 and the Kings' defensive struggles, this game projects well over 240.5 total points.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Green Bay (4-7) has a better record than IU Indy (3-8), and while IU Indy scores more points, they allow a staggering 94.2 points per game defensively. Green Bay's more balanced approach and slightly better overall record gives them the edge in this Horizon League matchup.",

The recent $1,040 bet on Pistons suggests sharp money, but without point spreads or moneyline odds, the value is unclear.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER\nReasoning: The Nuggets' franchise-best 17-6 start is powered by elite offense (Joki\u0107 averaging 25 PPG), while the Kings' defense is struggling badly, allowing 126 PPG recently. Both teams have offensive firepower, and Sacramento's defensive issues strongly favor an over result on 240.5 total points.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams are struggling (Green Bay 4-7, IU Indy 3-8) and winless in conference play (0-2 each). IU Indy scores more (87.0 PPG vs 72.1) but also allows significantly more (94.2 PPG vs 76.0), making this a toss-up between offense vs defense with insufficient edge to justify a position.",
