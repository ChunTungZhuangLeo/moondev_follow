  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong disagreement on Market 1 due to data reliability concerns, while Markets 2 and 3 show clearer alignment. Most models predict Racing Club's superior form makes an Estudiantes win unlikely (Market 2: NO) and that a draw is less probable than the market implies (Market 3: NO). Overall, predictions for the Argentine final are more confident than for the Serie A match, where inconsistent information creates significant uncertainty.",

Considering Cremonese's current momentum and Torino's difficulties, a bet on Cremonese winning seems justified.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Estudiantes de La Plata has demonstrated improved performance, advancing to the Torneo Clausura final by defeating strong opponents like Rosario Central and Central C\u00f3rdoba. Their resilience and recent successes suggest they have a good chance of winning against Racing Club.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Racing Club has an impressive record with five consecutive victories, indicating strong form and a likelihood of either winning or losing rather than drawing. Given their recent performances, a draw seems less likely.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: US Cremonese is playing away at Torino's Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, and despite Cremonese's recent good form (wins over Bologna and Lecce), winning away against a Serie A opponent is challenging. The recent $754 trade on No suggests market sentiment aligns with this view.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: This is a cup final against Racing Club, who have won five consecutive matches including impressive victories over River Plate and Boca Juniors. Finals are typically close affairs, and Racing's superior recent form makes an outright Estudiantes win less likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While finals can often be tight and end in draws (especially in regulation), Racing's strong form with 5 consecutive wins suggests they may be capable of deciding the match. The draw outcome is possible but the market dynamics and Racing's momentum make this unpredictable.",

Without reliable current form data for this specific match, I cannot make a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: This is a cup final between two strong teams. Racing Club has superior recent form with five consecutive victories including wins over River Plate and Boca Juniors, while Estudiantes' path shows they're competitive but facing a team in peak form. Finals are typically tight, making an outright Estudiantes win less likely than Racing winning or a draw.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While cup finals can end in draws, Racing Club's exceptional current form (5 straight wins against top opposition) suggests they're more likely to win outright. The recent betting market activity ($800 on Yes) may be overvaluing the draw probability given Racing's momentum advantage.",
