While there is optimism from teammates, the uncertainty surrounding his decision makes this a risky bet at the moment.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: FC Nantes is struggling with poor recent performance, having only 2 wins in their last 15 matches and currently ranking 17th in Ligue 1. In contrast, Angers SCO has shown better form and is positioned higher in the league, suggesting a higher likelihood of them winning the match.",

His teammates express confidence he'll play, and as the reigning World Cup champion at 38, the motivation to defend the title in a tournament partly hosted in the Americas makes participation likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: FC Nantes is in poor form (2 wins in 15 matches, 17th place) while playing away against Angers who has better recent form (5 wins in 15 matches, 11th place). The head-to-head record is even, but current form and home advantage favor Angers, making a Nantes win unlikely.",
