However, both teams have identical 6-4 recent form. The 90% market price is slightly elevated - Heroic should win but not with 90% certainty in a BO3 format.

With only 4 games remaining and trailing in the division, a 64% probability is significantly overvalued. They need to outperform the Steelers down the stretch while being behind in tiebreakers.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 90%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Not sufficient edge\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked 9th vs Pipsqueak+4 at 25th, and bookmaker odds of 1.24 (~80%) align with a Heroic advantage. The 90% market price is slightly high but both teams have identical 6-10 recent records, suggesting some upset potential.

The market at 33% for FURIA on Map 2 appears to significantly undervalue them given their dominant recent form and tournament championship win.
