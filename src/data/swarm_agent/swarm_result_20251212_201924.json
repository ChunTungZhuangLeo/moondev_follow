  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement to avoid trading on Markets 2 and 3 due to outdated or contradictory sport-specific data, creating high uncertainty.

Overall, the only market with a potential, albeit divided, signal is Market 1, while the others are deemed too speculative based on the provided information.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Real Sociedad's recent form and injury issues suggest a limited offensive output, while Girona's defensive capabilities make a high-scoring match unlikely. The $960.00 recent trade on \"Under\" reflects this expectation, making \"Under 3.5\" a more probable outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The historical head-to-head record between Team Falcons and PARIVISION is closely contested, with no recent match data to provide a clear advantage. Given the lack of current form information, taking a position in this market is too uncertain.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Monaco's recent victory in the Champions League, Fenerbah\u00e7e's historical success in the EuroLeague, including their recent championship title, suggests they might have the upper hand. The recent trade favoring Monaco may not fully account for Fenerbah\u00e7e's strong EuroLeague performance history.",

The recent $960 trade on Under aligns with expected low-scoring affair given the depleted offensive options.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news context is outdated (from August 2025) and provides no current information about team form, roster changes, or recent performance heading into this match. Without reliable current data on a volatile esports matchup, the risk is too high.\n\nMARKET 3: Monaco\nReasoning: This is a EuroLeague basketball match where Monaco plays at home. Despite Fenerbah\u00e7e's recent Final Four victory over Monaco, home court advantage in EuroLeague is significant, and Monaco has shown strong recent form across competitions. The recent trade activity supports Monaco.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Real Sociedad is missing key attacking players due to injury and recently lost 1-0, suggesting a lower-scoring game. The return of defender Igor Zubeldia further supports a potentially tighter defensive match, making under 3.5 goals more likely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news explicitly states that \"as of December 12, 2025, there is no record of a recent Dota 2 match between Team Falcons and PARIVISION,\" indicating the market may be for a non-existent or incorrectly dated event.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The recent performance news provided is for the soccer teams, not the basketball teams. The only relevant basketball context is Fenerbah\u00e7e defeating Monaco 81-70 in the 2025 EuroLeague Final Four, suggesting Fenerbah\u00e7e is the stronger team in this matchup.",

With both teams' defensive struggles and key absences, the match could go either way on total goals. Insufficient edge to predict over/under 3.5 goals confidently.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: No recent match data available for December 12, 2025 between Team Falcons and PARIVISION. The August 2025 head-to-head shows closely contested games (2-1 to Falcons), but without current form, roster changes, or tournament context, there's no reliable basis for prediction.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news context mixes basketball (EuroLeague Final Four) with football/soccer results (Monaco vs Galatasaray, Asensio's injury for Fenerbah\u00e7e), creating confusion about which sport this market covers. Without clarity on the actual matchup type and current form in the correct sport, cannot make an informed prediction.",
