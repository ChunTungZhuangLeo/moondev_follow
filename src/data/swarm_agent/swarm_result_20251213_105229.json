Given the close competition and Heidenheim's current form, it's uncertain enough to warrant a NO_TRADE decision.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Google's strong positioning with Gemini 2.5 Pro and previous top ranking, the launch of OpenAI's GPT-5.2 suggests a highly competitive environment. With OpenAI's aggressive advancements, it seems likely that Google may not hold the second-best position, favoring the NO outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: 1win has a better recent win rate compared to Nigma Galaxy, and despite losing their previous head-to-head, their current form suggests they have a higher chance of winning this BO3 series. The recent trade sentiment also supports a bet on 1win, making NO a reasonable choice.",
