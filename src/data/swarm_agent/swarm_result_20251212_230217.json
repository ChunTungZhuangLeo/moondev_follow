Reports from December 2025 indicate that the company has engaged the law firm Wilson Sonsini to assist with IPO preparations, though no formal timeline has been established.

However, they are coming off a five-day break, which head coach Kenny Atkinson utilized to refocus the team on fundamentals and accountability. Star player Donovan Mitchell continues to shine, averaging 30.5 points per game. Additionally, center Jarrett Allen is expected to return from a finger injury, potentially bolstering the team's defense.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 (Cavaliers) presents a clear \"YES\" trade with a significant edge, as most AIs see the market underestimating the probability.

The market price reflects this uncertainty appropriately, leaving insufficient edge for a clear trade.  \n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 50%  \nMarket Price: 49.4%  \nEdge: +0.6% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +$4.84 (Edge \u00d7 $807 potential payout)  \nReasoning: The Cavaliers are heavily favored, but their recent performance has been inconsistent. The return of Jarrett Allen could bolster their defense, yet the high spread and recent form make the probability close to a coin flip.
