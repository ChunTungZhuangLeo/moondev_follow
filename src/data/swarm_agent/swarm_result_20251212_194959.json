However, several factors provide insight into the potential outcome:\n\n**Recent News and Official Announcements:**\n\n- **Team Cherry's Perspective:** In a recent interview, Team Cherry, the developers of *Hollow Knight: Silksong*, expressed that they do not anticipate winning the Game of the Year award. Co-founder William Pellen mentioned that none of the team members plan to attend The Game Awards 2025 due to work commitments and their belief that *Silksong* will not secure the top honor.

The company has engaged the law firm Wilson Sonsini to assist with IPO preparations, though no formal timeline has been set. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-plans-an-ipo-early-2026-ft-reports-2025-12-03/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn September 2025, Anthropic completed a $13 billion Series F funding round, valuing the company at $183 billion post-money. ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/anthropic-completes-new-funding-round-at-183-billion-valuation?utm_source=openai)) The funding round was co-led by ICONIQ Capital, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from the Qatar Investment Authority and other investors.

On the esports match, most favor BetBoom Team to win Map 2 due to superior ranking and form, though some caution against trading due to historical map-specific volatility.",

Additionally, another game, *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*, is gaining industry recognition as a strong contender, further diminishing Silksong's chances.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although Anthropic is preparing for an IPO and has engaged legal counsel, there is no formal timeline set, making the prediction uncertain. The recent funding round suggests strong financial backing, but without a specified date for the IPO, it is too speculative to take a position.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: BetBoom Team has a higher world ranking and a strong recent performance record, including a 71% win rate over the past month, making them likely contenders to win Map 2 against Johnny Speeds, despite the previous loss on Overpass.",

Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is mentioned as a leading contender, making a Silksong win unlikely for the Steam Awards as well.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: While Anthropic is preparing for an IPO potentially in 2026, the market asks if they will NOT IPO by June 30, 2026. Given no formal timeline is set, IPO preparations typically take 6-12 months, and the June deadline is tight, it's more likely they won't complete an IPO by that specific date.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is a live esports match with high uncertainty. While BetBoom Team is ranked significantly higher (#22 vs #88) and has strong recent form (71% win rate), esports map outcomes are volatile and the match may already be in progress or concluded given the December 12 date.",

The market asks if they will NOT IPO by June 30, 2026 - given active preparations for early 2026, an IPO before the deadline appears likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While BetBoom Team is ranked higher (#22 vs #88) and has a strong 71% recent win rate, the historical head-to-head shows Johnny Speeds won Map 2 (Overpass) 13-7 in their October meeting. Without knowing the specific map for this Map 2, the outcome is too uncertain despite BetBoom's overall superiority.",
