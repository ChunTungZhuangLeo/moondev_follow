  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows a clear disagreement on Market 1's edge, while Markets 2 and 3 have more alignment on the direction but not the trade viability. Notably, all models recognize that Market 3's price at 96% is likely an overestimate, though only one calculates a positive edge for betting against it. The actionable summary is that no trade meets the strict 10%+ edge criteria with high confidence across all analyses.",
