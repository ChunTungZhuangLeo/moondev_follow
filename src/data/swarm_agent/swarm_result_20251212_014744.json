However, several developments provide insight into his potential bid:\n\n**Polls and Public Opinion:**\n\n- **May 2025:** An AtlasIntel poll indicated that 31.5% of Democratic voters supported Buttigieg for the 2028 nomination, leading the field ahead of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (19.4%) and former Vice President Kamala Harris (16.6%).

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (14%).

The outage lasted approximately three hours, with Cloudflare's CTO publicly apologizing for the incident. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/cloudflare-apologizes-after-outage-takes-major-websites-offline?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **December 5, 2025 Outage**: Another significant outage took place, impacting major platforms such as LinkedIn, Zoom, and gaming services like Fortnite and League of Legends. The disruption was caused by a configuration change related to mitigating a React Server Components vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182). Cloudflare restored services within 25 minutes and confirmed the issue was not due to a cyberattack.

This stopgap measure, signed into law by President Trump on November 12, 2025, was enacted to end a 43-day government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025. ([printing.org](https://www.printing.org/content/2025/11/14/federal-government-reopens-following-passage-of-short-term-funding-deal?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe shutdown was primarily due to Congress's failure to pass appropriations legislation for the 2026 fiscal year. The temporary funding package included full-year appropriations for three of the twelve fiscal year 2026 spending bills, covering the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch.

For the Cloudflare market, opinions are split between \"YES\" and \"NO,\" reflecting a debate over whether recent outages indicate a pattern or will prompt improved reliability. On the Buttigieg nomination, most models advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to extreme uncertainty this far from 2028, despite his early poll leads.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Pete Buttigieg has shown strong polling numbers, leading the field in some surveys, he has not yet declared his candidacy for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. The absence of a formal campaign announcement makes the outcome too uncertain to take a definitive position at this time.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Cloudflare has experienced two significant outages recently, but the company has quickly addressed the issues and taken steps to prevent further disruptions. Given the recent response and mitigation efforts, it seems less likely that another significant incident will occur before the year's end.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The U.S. government is operating under a temporary funding measure that expires on January 30, 2026, and past difficulties in passing appropriations suggest a high risk of another shutdown. The recent history of a 43-day shutdown and reliance on a stopgap measure indicate a strong possibility of a repeat situation.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: While Buttigieg leads early 2028 Democratic polls (19-31% support), it's far too early to predict the nomination with confidence. The field will likely expand significantly, and early frontrunners often don't win nominations. At current implied odds, this isn't a compelling bet.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: There have already been two significant Cloudflare incidents in late 2025 (November 18 and December 5), demonstrating a pattern of outages. With 19 days remaining in December and Cloudflare's recent reliability issues, another critical incident is plausible before year-end.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The current funding measure expires January 30, 2026, just one day before the market deadline. Given Congress just experienced a 43-day shutdown and only passed partial appropriations (3 of 12 bills), the risk of another shutdown is substantial as negotiations on remaining spending bills face the same partisan obstacles.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While early polls show Buttigieg leading potential contenders, the 2028 nomination is over two years away and no candidate has officially declared, making this highly speculative and subject to significant change.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Given Cloudflare has already experienced two major, publicly acknowledged outages in November and December 2025, and the market deadline is December 31, the short remaining window and the company's likely heightened operational focus after recent incidents reduce the probability of another critical event.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The government is currently funded only by a temporary measure expiring on January 30, 2026, and Congress has a recent history of failing to pass full appropriations, creating a high risk of another shutdown just after the market's January 31 deadline.",

The field remains wide open with multiple strong contenders, making this too uncertain to trade nearly 3 years out.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: With only 19 days remaining until December 31 and two major incidents already resolved in November and December, Cloudflare has likely implemented additional safeguards. The recent incidents were quickly resolved (25 minutes to 3 hours), suggesting improved response capabilities.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The current continuing resolution expires January 30, 2026, just one day before the market deadline. Given the 43-day shutdown that just ended in November 2025 and ongoing congressional dysfunction, there's significant risk of another shutdown when this temporary funding expires.",
