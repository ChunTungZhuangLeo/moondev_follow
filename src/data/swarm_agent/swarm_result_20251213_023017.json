Bookmaker odds of 2.2 imply ~45% probability.

With Zaragoza in good home form and C\u00e1diz struggling, a decisive result seems more likely than a draw. Market may be slightly overpricing the draw, but edge is insufficient.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: Epstein or Maxwell confirmed Mossad operatives in 2025?\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 97.2%\nEdge: -94.2%\nExpected Value: Excellent (betting NO at 2.8% for ~3% true probability)\nReasoning: The market is pricing NO at 97.2%, meaning YES is at 2.8%. With only ~18 days left in 2025 and zero credible evidence or official confirmation emerging despite years of speculation, the probability of official confirmation is essentially nil. Wait - I need to re-read this. The market asks if they WILL BE confirmed, priced at 97.2% YES. This seems inverted. If YES is 97.2%, that's wildly mispriced given no evidence exists.\n\nDecision: NO",
