In July 2025, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett categorically denied such allegations, describing them as \"a vicious wave of slander and lies\" against Israel. ([time.com](https://time.com/7302177/epstein-mossad-israel-intelligence-naftali-bennett/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the United States, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, enacted on November 19, 2025, mandates the release of unclassified documents related to Epstein and Maxwell by December 19, 2025. While these documents are expected to provide further insights into their activities, they are not anticipated to reveal any new information regarding connections to Mossad.

Without an extension, premiums for ACA Marketplace plans are projected to more than double in 2026, potentially leading to approximately 4 million individuals becoming uninsured. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/aca-premiums-to-more-than-double-without-enhanced-subsidies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent legislative efforts have been unsuccessful in extending these subsidies. On December 12, 2025, the U.S. Senate voted down both Democratic and Republican proposals to extend the enhanced subsidies, leaving millions at risk of significant premium increases starting January 1, 2026.

Under the leadership of manager St\u00e5le Solbakken, Norway achieved a perfect record in the UEFA World Cup qualifiers, securing eight wins from eight matches and finishing with a +32 goal difference. ([fifa2026.futbol](https://www.fifa2026.futbol/norway/?utm_source=openai))\n\nCentral to this success is striker Erling Haaland, who scored 16 goals during the qualifying campaign, matching Robert Lewandowski's record for the most prolific UEFA World Cup qualification campaign. ([theanalyst.com](https://theanalyst.com/articles/world-cup-2026-predictions-opta-supercomputers-pre-draw-projections?utm_source=openai)) Haaland's leadership and goal-scoring prowess have been instrumental in Norway's resurgence on the international stage.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: As of December 13, 2025, there is no confirmed evidence or credible developments suggesting that Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell were operatives of Mossad. With significant public denials and the upcoming release of documents not expected to reveal any new connections, it is unlikely that such confirmation will occur.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The enhanced ACA premium tax credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025, and recent legislative efforts to extend them have failed. Additionally, the Democratic Party's chances in the 2026 House elections remain uncertain but plausible, making the combination of both outcomes a reasonable possibility.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Norway's impressive performance and Erling Haaland's exceptional form, winning the FIFA World Cup is highly competitive and unpredictable. Given the historical dominance of other footballing nations, betting against Norway's winning the World Cup remains a prudent choice.",

Additionally, the upcoming release of Epstein files is not anticipated to reveal Mossad connections.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While the ACA premium tax credits are highly likely not to be extended given the recent Senate vote, the Democratic Party faces an uphill battle to win the House in 2026, with historical trends favoring the party out of presidential power. Since both conditions must be met for \"Yes,\" the unlikelihood of a Democratic House win makes \"No\" the more probable outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Norway's strong performance in qualifiers and the presence of Erling Haaland, the Opta Supercomputer projects only a 12% chance of them winning the World Cup, and bookmakers place them as 8th favorites with a 5% implied probability. These odds are too low to bet on a \"Yes\" outcome.",

Democrats are well-positioned for 2026 House gains as Republicans will face backlash for premium increases affecting 4 million people.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Norway's perfect qualifying record and Haaland's exceptional form, winning the World Cup requires defeating multiple elite teams.

While the credits appear likely to expire (Senate just voted down extensions), the second condition of Democrats winning the House in 2026 is uncertain and historically challenging for the opposition party. The conjunction of both events makes this a lower probability bet.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Norway's impressive qualifying campaign with Haaland's 16 goals, winning a World Cup requires defeating multiple elite nations like France, Argentina, Brazil, and England. Norway lacks the tournament experience and squad depth of traditional powerhouses, making a World Cup victory extremely unlikely even with their strong recent form.",
