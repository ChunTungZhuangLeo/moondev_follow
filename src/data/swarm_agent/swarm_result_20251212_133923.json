  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for Market 1 due to Real Sociedad's key absences and poor form, while Market 3 leans \"No\" from skepticism about sustaining its high valuation post-launch despite strong backing. For Market 2, opinions are split between \"Yes\" (citing escalating military actions) and \"No\" (viewing operations as anti-drug, not direct engagement), indicating high uncertainty. Overall, Markets 1 and 3 show clear agreement against the proposition, whereas Market 2 lacks a definitive consensus due to differing interpretations of the military context.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Real Sociedad is without key players like Oyarzabal, Oskarsson, and Herrera, which significantly weakens their team. Given their recent losing streak and these absences, it's unlikely they will win by more than 1.5 goals against Girona.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The presence of a substantial U.S. naval force near Venezuela and ongoing airstrikes suggest a heightened military posture. These significant military activities increase the likelihood of an engagement by March 31, 2026.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite the strong backing and innovative approach of Almanak, the most recent valuation was $90 million FDV in August 2025. Given the recent trade trends and the market's skepticism, it seems unlikely that the FDV will consistently stay above $80 million just one day after the launch.",

Covering a -1.5 spread against Girona while on a two-match losing streak with these absences is unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The news indicates significant escalation with 15,000 US personnel deployed near Venezuela, airstrikes already occurring in the region with 87 fatalities, creating conditions where a formal military engagement by March 2026 is plausible given current trajectory.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The community round was at $90M FDV, but the earlier IDO was at $43M valuation. Post-TGE price action often sees selling pressure, and achieving >$80M FDV one day after launch is uncertain given typical token launch volatility and unlock dynamics.",

A -1.5 spread requires them to win by 2+ goals, which seems unlikely given their depleted squad and poor form.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While tensions are elevated with US naval deployment and airstrikes targeting drug traffickers, these operations are focused on counter-narcotics rather than direct military engagement with Venezuela. The strikes have been against vessels, not Venezuelan military targets, making full military engagement unlikely by March 2026.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The recent trade heavily favored \"No\" ($882.89), and while Almanak raised significant funds, their community round was already valued at $90M FDV in August 2025. Expecting the FDV to drop below $80M one day after launch (when initial excitement is typically highest) seems unlikely given their strong backing and prior valuations.",
