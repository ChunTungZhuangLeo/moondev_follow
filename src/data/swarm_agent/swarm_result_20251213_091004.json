  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's \"YES\" price is vastly overvalued, with all models estimating a true probability near 5% versus a 94.9% market price, creating a massive edge to bet \"NO.\" For Market 3, there is notable disagreement, with one model seeing a 16.9% edge on \"YES\" while another finds no actionable trade, indicating higher uncertainty. Market 2 shows mixed signals, with no clear 10%+ edge consensus, leading most models to recommend no trade.",
