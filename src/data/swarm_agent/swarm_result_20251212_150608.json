  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows clear agreement on Market 2 (NO) due to the lack of time and official action in 2025, and on Market 3 (NO/NO_TRADE) given US Lecce's poor league position making a 1.5-goal win unlikely. For Market 1, opinions are split between YES (favoring Fulham's betting odds) and NO/NO_TRADE (citing recent poor form), indicating high uncertainty. Overall, the predictions are most confident against cannabis rescheduling and Lecce covering the spread, while the football match is seen as a toss-up.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Fulham FC is the favorite against Burnley FC, both teams have recently suffered losses. The betting odds slightly favor Fulham, but the recent performance of both teams suggests an unpredictable match outcome. Therefore, the uncertainty makes it difficult to confidently predict a win for Fulham.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: As of December 12, 2025, there have been no official announcements or significant developments regarding the rescheduling of cannabis. The DEA still classifies cannabis as a Schedule I substance, and although there is ongoing legislative discussion, no concrete changes have been made. This makes it unlikely that rescheduling will occur in 2025.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: US Lecce's position in Serie A and their recent performance, including only a narrow victory over Torino FC, suggest that they may struggle to cover a -1.5 spread against Pisa SC. Given their current standing and recent match outcomes, they are unlikely to win by more than 1.5 goals.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: Fulham enters as favorites (-105, ~51.2% implied probability) against Burnley, and despite recent losses, this is likely a Premier League vs Championship matchup where Fulham's quality should prevail. The $1,000 trade on Yes aligns with the betting market sentiment.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: With only ~3 weeks left in 2025 and recent news confirming the DEA maintains cannabis as Schedule I with no official rescheduling announcements, there's insufficient time for the complex regulatory process to complete this year. The $2,000 trade on No reflects this reality.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The market title references \"US Lecce (-1.5)\" but Lecce is a struggling Serie A team (17th place, 3-4-7 record) unlikely to cover a 1.5 goal spread against most opponents. The context is unclear about the specific matchup, making this too risky to trade.",

The recent $2,000 No trade aligns with this timeline reality.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Lecce sits 17th in Serie A (relegation zone) with a poor 3-4-7 record. A -1.5 spread requires them to win by 2+ goals, which seems unlikely given their position and form. The recent $1,200 bet on Pisa SC (taking the spread) appears more rational.",
