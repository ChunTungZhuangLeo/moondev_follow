      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The unemployment rate increased to 4.4% in September 2025, and recent economic indicators suggest a trend toward a higher unemployment rate. Initial jobless claims rose significantly in December, hinting at potential labor market challenges. Therefore, it's reasonable to anticipate the unemployment rate could reach or exceed 4.6% by November 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: There is currently no substantial evidence or official indication that Maduro will be out of office by the end of 2026. However, geopolitical tensions, such as the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker, could potentially influence political dynamics in Venezuela. Without more definitive developments, it's prudent to refrain from taking a position.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Fernando Mendoza is the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy, having led Indiana to an undefeated season and secured the Big Ten Championship. His impressive statistics and performance in critical games position him strongly as the likely winner of the award.",

There's no credible evidence suggesting he will resign or be ousted, and authoritarian leaders rarely leave voluntarily without overwhelming internal pressure.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Mendoza is the clear frontrunner with exceptional stats (33 TDs, 13-0 record, Big Ten Championship, #1 CFP seed) and the ceremony is tomorrow (December 13).
