Consequently, prediction markets on platforms like Polymarket, which allow users to speculate on the FDV of Fogo's token one day after its launch, are currently inactive. For instance, the market titled \"Fogo FDV above ___ one day after launch?\" has not been initiated, as indicated by the absence of trading data.

A market titled \"Khamenei out as Supreme Leader of Iran by June 30?\" has garnered significant attention, with a trading volume of $54,815 and current odds suggesting a 21% chance of his removal by the specified date.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely overpriced at 94.5%, with most AIs estimating a true probability near or below 50%, creating a significant edge for a \"NO\" trade. For Market 1, opinions are mixed on the exact edge, leading to a split between \"NO_TRADE\" and slight directional bets, indicating the market is generally seen as fairly priced. On Market 3, most analysts believe the \"YES\" price is too high, but there is notable disagreement on the recommended action, ranging from a high-edge \"NO\" bet to a cautious \"NO_TRADE.\"",

The Bears are still favored, but the market may be overestimating their likelihood of winning by such a wide margin.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 94.5%\nEdge: -44.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$44.50 per $100 bet\nReasoning: With no available information on Fogo's token launch and FDV, it's speculative to assume such a high probability of the FDV being over $2B.

The 7.5-point spread aligns with roughly 70-75% win probability for Chicago. While Sanders showed promise, the Browns' injuries and overall record suggest they're outmatched.

      "response": "# Polymarket Market Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 77.0%\nEdge: -2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Browns (3-10) face Bears (9-4) with Bears favored by 7.5 points. While rookie QB Shedeur Sanders showed promise (364 yards, 3 TDs), the Browns still lost and face a much stronger team. The 77% market price for Bears victory is roughly aligned with a 7.5-point favorite's historical win rate (~75-80%). Insufficient edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: Unable to estimate\nMarket Price: 94.5%\nEdge: Cannot calculate\nExpected Value: Cannot calculate\nReasoning: No public information exists about Fogo's token launch date, tokenomics, or FDV projections. The market appears to be speculative with no concrete data. Without knowing when/if launch will occur or any fundamentals, this is pure gambling rather than informed prediction. Avoid entirely.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 80.3%\nEdge: +54.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Highly Positive (+54.7% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Market shows 80.3% NO (19.7% YES). However, Israeli strikes killed top IRGC leadership in June 2025, creating unprecedented instability. Khamenei is 86 years old with health concerns. The regime faces its greatest crisis in decades. While removal by June 30, 2026 is still unlikely, 35% probability is far more realistic than market's 19.7%. This represents massive edge on YES side - the market is significantly underpricing regime change risk given recent military losses and leadership deaths.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: Strong YES bet on Market 3 with 54.7% edge**",
