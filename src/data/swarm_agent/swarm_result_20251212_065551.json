Home advantage helps, but their 4W-4D-6L record suggests ~40-45% win probability, not 56%.

Sociedad just lost 1-0 to Alav\u00e9s and their form is inconsistent. Home edge gives them slight favorite status, but 56% market price is roughly fair given both teams' poor form.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -92.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: This market is INVERTED - it's asking if FDV will be >$10B. The 97.1% price means market thinks it WON'T exceed $10B. Lighter raised at $1.5B valuation, and reaching $10B FDV (6.7x jump) one day after launch is extremely unlikely without massive hype. The NO side (betting it stays under $10B) is correctly priced. This is a NO bet opportunity with massive edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: +4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Marginal positive\nReasoning: Thunder are on a historic 16-game win streak with a 24-1 record, just destroyed the Suns 138-89, and have the best 25-game start in NBA history. Spurs are competitive but Thunder's current form is exceptional. Market at 81% slightly undervalues Thunder's dominance, but edge is below 10% threshold for recommendation.\n\n**WAIT - RECHECKING MARKET 3:**\nThe market title is \"Spurs vs. Thunder\" and the 81% price with recent trade on \"Thunder\" suggests 81% is Thunder's probability to win. My analysis stands but edge is only +4%, below threshold.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n**STRONG BET: Market 2 - NO** (Bet that Lighter stays UNDER $10B FDV)\n- Market is pricing NO at 97.1%, which is correct\n- This appears to be the YES side that's mispriced at 2.9%\n- Do NOT bet YES - the 2.9% on YES side is the trap\n\n**NO TRADES on Markets 1 and 3** - Insufficient edge",
