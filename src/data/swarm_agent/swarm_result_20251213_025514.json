  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets and provide your predictions.\nYou have been given RECENT NEWS AND CONTEXT from web search for each market.\nUse this information to make more informed predictions.\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Maduro out by December 31, 2026?\nRecent trade: $897.27 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/maduro-out-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no official announcement indicating that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro plans to resign by December 31, 2026. Recent developments, however, provide context that may influence such a decision.\n\n**Political Developments:**\n\n- **2025 Presidential Inauguration:** On January 10, 2025, Maduro was inaugurated for a third term, extending his presidency until 2031. This event occurred amid domestic and international criticism of the 2024 election process, which was deemed neither free nor fair. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_inauguration_of_Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2025 Parliamentary Elections:** Held on May 25, 2025, these elections resulted in the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) retaining its majority in the National Assembly, securing 253 out of 285 seats. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Venezuelan_parliamentary_election?utm_source=openai))\n\n**International Relations:**\n\n- **...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 140-159 tweets from December 12 to December 19, 2025?\nRecent trade: $1,520.03 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nElon Musk's Twitter activity has been notably high, with recent analyses indicating an average of 68 to 110 tweets per day over the past year. ([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/BKwzICm9XkZbTHxcjv9seORNU?utm_source=openai)) This consistent posting pattern suggests that he is likely to tweet between 476 and 770 times from December 12 to December 19, 2025.\n\nIn the prediction market \"Will Elon Musk post 140-159 tweets from December 12 to December 19, 2025?\", the \"Yes\" outcome is currently priced at 1.4%, reflecting a low probability of Musk posting within this range. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19-140-159?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven Musk's established high tweeting frequency, it is improbable that he will post between 140 and 159 tweets during this period.\n\n\n## Elon Musk's Twitter Activity and Market Predictions:\n- [Musk hints at possible SpaceX IPO in X post after media reports](https://www.r...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Up Only podcast released by December 31?\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/up-only-podcast-released-by-october-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe \"UpOnly\" podcast is a cryptocurrency-focused show that has gained popularity within the crypto community. As of December 13, 2025, there have been no official announcements regarding a new episode release by December 31, 2025.\n\nHowever, there is a prediction market on Polymarket titled \"Which guests will appear on the UpOnly podcast by December 31?\" This market allows participants to speculate on potential guest appearances on the podcast by the specified date. Notably, the market has seen significant trading volume, indicating active participation and interest. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/which-guests-will-appear-on-the-uponly-podcast-by-december-31?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency industry and the podcast's history of featuring prominent figures, it's possible that new episodes with notable guests may be released before the end of the year. However, without official confirmation, any predictions remain speculative. \n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly predicts NO for Markets 1 and 2, based on Maduro's secure political position and Musk's high tweet frequency. The only significant disagreement is on Market 3, where three AIs advise NO_TRADE due to a lack of official information, while one argues YES based on related market activity. Overall, the predictions for Markets 1 and 2 are highly confident, while Market 3 remains speculative.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was inaugurated for a third term in January 2025, extending his presidency until 2031. With no indications of an impending resignation or removal and his party holding a strong majority in the National Assembly, it is unlikely he will be out by December 31, 2026.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Elon Musk's tweeting activity averages between 68 and 110 tweets per day, suggesting he would likely exceed the 140-159 tweet range during the specified period. The current market pricing of a 1.4% probability for \"Yes\" reflects this expectation.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While there is interest and speculation regarding new episodes of the \"UpOnly\" podcast, there have been no official announcements confirming an episode release by December 31, 2025.
