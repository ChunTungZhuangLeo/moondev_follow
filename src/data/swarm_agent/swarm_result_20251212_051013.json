  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Bulls vs. Hornets\nCurrent Market Price: 58.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $6,445.88 on Bulls\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/nba-chi-cha-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe Chicago Bulls and Charlotte Hornets are set to face off tonight, Friday, December 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM PST in Charlotte. Both teams are aiming to break recent losing streaks: the Bulls have lost seven consecutive games, while the Hornets have dropped three of their last four. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performances:**\n\n- **Chicago Bulls:** In their most recent game, the Bulls suffered a 123-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors, marking their worst offensive performance of the season. Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for improved team effort and attention to detail to overcome the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets are dealing with multiple injuries, including key players LaMelo Ball, Tre Mann, Collin Sexton, and Moussa Diabate\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?\nCurrent Market Price: 40.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $970.72 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-kabuto-1st-edition-card-hit-100-by-december-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe value of first-edition Kabuto Pok\u00e9mon cards has experienced a significant surge in recent months, primarily due to the efforts of an anonymous collector known as \"Kabuto King.\" Since August 2025, Kabuto King has amassed over 1,700 of these cards, leading to a dramatic increase in their market price. Prior to this collection spree, first-edition Kabuto cards were valued at under a dollar; by December 2025, their price had risen to over $37. ([wargamer.com](https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/kabuto-king-first-edition-collection-prices?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn early December 2025, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card, with all proceeds benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The auction concluded with a final bid of $51,100, highlighting the card's newfound value and the collector's commitment to charitable causes.

However, recent developments provide insight into potential future actions.\n\n**Recent Federal Reserve Actions and Projections:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75% in its December 2025 meeting. This decision was accompanied by projections indicating only one more 25 bps cut in 2026, suggesting a cautious approach to further rate reductions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-signals-pause-rate-cuts-investors-navigate-data-darkness-leadership-change-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Economic Forecasts:** The Fed's optimistic 2026 forecast includes increased GDP growth (from 1.8% to 2.3%) and slightly reduced inflation expectations (from 2.6% to 2.4%), partly attributed to elevated productivity\u2014fueled in par\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge favoring \"YES\" on the Kabuto card market, with three AIs recommending the trade due to speculative momentum. For the Bulls game, opinions are split on the winner but agree the edge is insufficient for a trade. Regarding the Fed decision, most analyses find no actionable opportunity, aligning with a cautious view against the market's high implied probability.",

Road games are harder, and while Hornets are depleted, the Bulls' recent collapse suggests deep systemic issues. This is closer to a coin flip than 58% implies, but edge is below 10% threshold.\n\n**DECISION: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -15%\nExpected Value: 15% \u00d7 1.67 = +25% ROI on NO\nReasoning: Card went from <$1 to ~$37 due to one collector's manipulation. To reach $100 by Dec 31 (19 days) requires nearly 3x increase. The \"Kabuto King\" has already demonstrated charitable intent by auctioning cards, suggesting potential sell-off rather than continued accumulation. Market manipulation bubbles typically don't sustain exponential growth, and the artificial nature of this price increase makes $100 unlikely in such a short timeframe.\n\n**DECISION: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -69%\nExpected Value: 69% \u00d7 5.26 = +363% ROI on NO\nReasoning: The Fed just cut in December 2025 and explicitly signaled only ONE more cut in all of 2026, with a \"cautious approach.\" Fed projections show improved GDP growth (2.3%) and moderating inflation - conditions that don't warrant aggressive January cuts. The Fed typically pauses after signaling caution. Market at 81% seems dramatically mispriced given the Fed's own forward guidance suggesting they'll skip January.\n\n**DECISION: NO**",

Bulls should be favored at home court advantage... wait, game is IN Charlotte. Still, Hornets' injury situation is catastrophic. Bulls likely win but edge is only 7%, below our 10% threshold for action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto 1st Edition Card hitting $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability:** 15%\n**Market Price:** 40%\n**Edge:** -25% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong negative, favor NO\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Card currently at ~$37 after massive artificial pump by \"Kabuto King.\" Needs to nearly triple in 19 days to hit $100. The $51k auction was for a SIGNED card (completely different asset). Market is severely overpricing this - classic pump-and-dump pattern where one collector controls supply. Normal cards won't reach $100 by year-end.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed 25bps Cut in January 2026\n**Your Probability:** 8%\n**Market Price:** 81%\n**Edge:** -73% (Your prob - Market)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Fed just cut in December 2025 and explicitly projected only ONE more 25bps cut for ALL of 2026. They raised GDP forecasts and showed hawkish stance. With improved economic outlook and only one cut planned for entire year, January cut is extremely unlikely - they'll wait to assess data. Market is dramatically overpricing this at 81%.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- **Market 1 (Bulls):** NO_TRADE (insufficient edge)\n- **Market 2 (Kabuto):** **BET NO** (25% edge)\n- **Market 3 (Fed Cut):** **BET NO** (73% edge - STRONGEST CONVICTION)\n\nThe Fed market shows the most significant mispricing with a massive 73% edge on the NO side.",
