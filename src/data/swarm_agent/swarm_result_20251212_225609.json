For example, an O/U of 3.5 goals means betting on whether the total goals scored by both teams will be over or under 3.5. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/betting/over-under-totals-betting?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn recent sports events, several games have had O/U totals around 3.5 goals.

Early box office projections estimate a domestic opening weekend between $100 million and $130 million, with a central estimate of approximately $110 million. ([hypebeast.com](https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/james-cameron-avatar-fire-and-ash-projected-box-office-debut-100-million-usd-news?utm_source=openai)) This range suggests that the film's opening weekend box office could fall between $101 million and $112 million.\n\nThese projections are slightly below the opening weekend of its predecessor, \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" which debuted with $134.1 million in 2022.

Their most recent encounter occurred during the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Cologne 2025, where NAVI eliminated FaZe with a 2-0 victory in the Group B lower bracket final.
