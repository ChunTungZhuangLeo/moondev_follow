Given their recent scoring trends and struggles in finding the back of the net, it's likely that the total goals will be under 2.5.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Blackburn Rovers have shown mixed form with a recent win and a draw, while Portsmouth recently lost their last match. However, the information does not provide a clear advantage to either team, making it difficult to confidently predict Blackburn's victory, especially with the recent trade heavily favoring a \"No\" outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Middlesbrough FC has been in excellent form with three consecutive wins and a strong home record, having only lost once at Riverside Stadium since April. Although QPR is also performing well, Middlesbrough's recent form and home advantage suggest a favorable outcome for them.",
