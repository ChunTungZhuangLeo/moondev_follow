With ~20 days remaining in 2025 and wealthy foreign nationals actively seeking US residency pathways, even ONE sale makes this resolve NO. The $1M price point is achievable for the target demographic, and the program has received significant publicity.

The web search itself shows Polymarket at 37% for this outcome, yet this market shows 61% - a major discrepancy. Military/regime loyalty remains intact, and ~3.5 months is insufficient for regime change without a coup. Historical precedent strongly favors Maduro's survival.",
