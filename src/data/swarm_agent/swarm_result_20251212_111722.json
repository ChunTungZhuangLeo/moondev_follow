The Angers SCO match is divisive, with models split between a \"YES\" trade and \"NO_TRADE,\" indicating no clear consensus on a 10%+ edge.",

Home wins in Ligue 1 for mid-table teams typically hover around 40-45%.

Market sentiment is clearly cooling. Achieving $3B FDV one day post-launch is extremely ambitious even for hyped DeFi protocols, and the downward trend in prediction market odds suggests insider sentiment is bearish.\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -90.9%\nExpected Value: This market appears to be displaying incorrectly - the search shows Rubio at only 3.5% on Polymarket with Vance leading at 28%. The 95.9% price is likely an error or misread. If accurate at 95.9%, this is a strong NO.\nReasoning: Rubio explicitly endorsed Vance for 2028, hasn't declared candidacy, and actual Polymarket data shows him at 3.5%. The 95.9% figure appears to be a data error - if real, this is massively mispriced and a clear NO bet.",
