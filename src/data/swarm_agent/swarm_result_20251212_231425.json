This line is commonly used in sports like soccer, hockey, and basketball.\n\n**Recent News and Updates:**\n\n- **Soccer:** In the English Premier League, matches involving high-scoring teams like Manchester City and Liverpool often see over/under lines set at 3.5. Recent fixtures have seen fluctuating goal totals, with some matches exceeding this line and others falling short.\n\n- **Hockey:** The NHL has experienced a trend towards higher-scoring games this season, leading bookmakers to adjust over/under lines. Games involving teams with strong offensive records, such as the Colorado Avalanche, frequently have totals set at 3.5 or higher.\n\n- **Basketball:** In the NBA, the over/under for total points in a game is typically set much higher than 3.5, often ranging from 200 to 240 points.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends a YES trade on Market 2 (Paderborn win), with all AIs agreeing on a significant edge (14-16%) above the 44% market price. For Markets 1 and 3, most AIs advise NO_TRADE due to insufficient or negative edge, though there is notable disagreement on the true probability for the NBA over/under. Overall, Market 2 is the only clear, actionable opportunity meeting the 10%+ edge requirement.",

Historical data shows these teams typically play competitive series that can go either way on game count. The market context was misleading (showing traditional sports), but for LoL best-of-5s between top Korean teams, 3.5 games over has around 65-70% historical probability.

Ja Morant is questionable but likely to return, which increases pace and scoring. Jazz rookies are developing offensively. The 242.5 line is reasonable for this matchup, but the over has 60-65% true probability given both teams' pace metrics and recent scoring trends.\n\n**Decision: YES** - 12% edge provides solid value on the over.",
