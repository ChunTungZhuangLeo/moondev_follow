([bearyangry.com](https://bearyangry.com/2025/10/18/openai-confirms-gpt%E2%80%916-is-not-shipping-in-2025/?utm_source=openai)) This decision aligns with OpenAI's focus on enhancing the GPT-5 series, with incremental updates such as GPT-5.5 anticipated instead of a full new generation.\n\nIndustry analysts and insiders suggest that GPT-6 is under internal development, but public deployment is likely \"at least months away,\" with projections pointing towards late 2026 or early 2027. ([zoonop.com](https://zoonop.com/articles/openai-confirms-gpt-6-not-expected-in-2025-shifts-focus-to-integration-post-gpt-5-debut?utm_source=openai)) OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has hinted that the gap between GPT-5 and GPT-6 will be shorter than the interval between GPT-4 and GPT-5, but no specific date has ...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Real Madrid CF win on 2025-12-14?\nRecent trade: $715.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/lal-ala-rea-2025-12-14\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nReal Madrid CF is scheduled to play against Alav\u00e9s on Sunday, December 14, 2025, at 1:00 PM local time in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

Despite an early lead from Rodrygo, City capitalized on defensive errors, with Thibaut Courtois's misplay leading to an equalizer and a penalty converted by Erling Haaland.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for GPT-6's 2025 release, as all AIs agree OpenAI's official confirmation makes this definitive. For the Israel-Lebanon strike, most predict \"No\" due to a lack of specific December 12th plans, though one dissenting \"Yes\" vote cites a pattern of ongoing strikes. Predictions for the Real Madrid match are split between \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and \"No Trade,\" reflecting disagreement on whether the team's recent poor form or inherent superiority will determine the outcome.",

The situation is tense, but without concrete information on an imminent strike, it is prudent to avoid taking a position.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: OpenAI has officially confirmed that GPT-6 will not be released by December 31, 2025, and industry analysts support this timeline, suggesting a release much later. This makes it highly unlikely for GPT-6 to be released by the end of the year.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Real Madrid has shown recent weaknesses with two consecutive losses, but they are still a strong team. Without specific insights into the form of Alav\u00e9s or further details on Real Madrid's lineup and strategy for the upcoming match, it is difficult to confidently predict the outcome.",

With only ~19 days remaining and no indication of a reversal, this is essentially a certainty for NO.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Despite recent losses to Manchester City and Celta Vigo, Real Madrid remains a significantly stronger team than Alav\u00e9s and should be favored in this La Liga match.

However, with the market date being December 12 and recent trades heavily favoring \"No\" ($569), it appears the market consensus is that no significant strike occurred on that specific date, which aligns with the lack of reported strikes for December 12 specifically.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: OpenAI officially confirmed in October 2025 that GPT-6 will not ship in 2025, with projections pointing to late 2026 or early 2027. This is definitive information that makes this an extremely high-confidence \"No\" bet.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Real Madrid has shown poor recent form with consecutive losses (2-1 to Manchester City on Dec 10, 2-0 to Celta Vigo on Dec 7 with 2 red cards), indicating defensive vulnerabilities and potential squad issues. While they're favorites against Alav\u00e9s, their current momentum suggests caution, and the recent $715 \"Yes\" trade may be overconfident given their struggles.",
