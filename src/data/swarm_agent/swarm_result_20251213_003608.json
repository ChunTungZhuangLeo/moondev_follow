On December 11, Russian military commanders reported to President Vladimir Putin that Russian forces had captured Siversk, a town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. They described the capture as a significant step toward advancing toward Sloviansk, another major city still under Ukrainian control. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commanders-tell-putin-that-russia-has-captured-siversk-eastern-ukraine-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian military has firmly denied these claims. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian military's Operation Task Force East stated that Siversk remains under Ukrainian control, despite ongoing Russian attempts to infiltrate the area. They reported that Russian forces are trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavorable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches.
