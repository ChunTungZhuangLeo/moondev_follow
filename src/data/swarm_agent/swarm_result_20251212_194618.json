  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as severely mispriced, with all models agreeing a \"NO\" trade holds a massive edge against the 92.8% price for Braunschweig to win. For Market 1, most analysts see a slight edge for Heroic but disagree on whether it meets the 10% threshold for a recommended trade. Regarding Market 3, opinions are split between seeing value on \"YES\" for over 2.5 goals or finding no clear edge, indicating higher uncertainty.",
