  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts Middlesbrough FC will win, while opinions are split on the Trump pardon market due to differing interpretations of recent commutations. All analysts agree a US strike on Nigeria is highly unlikely, citing a lack of confirmed action despite surveillance reports. The main disagreement centers on whether Trump's pardon pattern increases risk for the listed individuals or if their notoriety makes clemency improbable.",

The absence of definitive plans for a strike suggests that it is unlikely to happen within the specified timeframe.",

The home advantage and superior league position make a Middlesbrough win likely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: While Trump has shown willingness to grant controversial pardons (like David Gentile), the specific individuals listed (Diddy, Maxwell, SBF, Holmes, Chauvin) represent extremely high-profile and politically toxic cases.

Nigeria is a sovereign ally, and conducting military strikes there would be a massive diplomatic escalation with no apparent justification or precedent.

The U.S.-Nigeria relationship focuses on security cooperation, not offensive operations, and a strike would represent a major policy shift requiring significant justification.",
