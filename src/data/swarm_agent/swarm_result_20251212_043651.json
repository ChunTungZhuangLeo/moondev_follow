([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_Files_Transparency_Act?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Judicial Approvals:** Federal judges have authorized the release of grand jury transcripts and other documents related to Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. These decisions align with the new law, which requires the Department of Justice to disclose unclassified materials within 30 days of the president's signing. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-clears-justice-department-release-epstein-grand-jury-transcripts-2025-12-05/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Legislative Action:** The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Attorney General to release all unclassified documents...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 460-479 tweets from December 5 to December 12, 2025?\nRecent trade: $947.33 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-5-december-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nElon Musk's tweeting frequency has varied significantly over time. Historically, he averaged approximately 12 posts per day since June 2009. However, during periods of heightened activity, such as around the 2024 U.S. elections, his posting rate spiked to over 100 posts per day. ([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/geEWerzeJ8rPmpqT6YEsKPoNk?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent data indicates that Musk's activity on X (formerly Twitter) has been substantial. For instance, in November 2024, he posted 3,200 times in a single month, averaging about 106 posts per day. ([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/geEWerzeJ8rPmpqT6YEsKPoNk?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the period from December 5 to December 12, 2025, Musk's posting frequency has been notably high. Prediction markets, such as Polymarket, have observed significant trading volumes on events predicting his tweet counts during this timeframe. For example, one market had a volume of $6,102,314, with the 460-479 tweet range attractin...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 500+ tweets from December 5 to December 12, 2025?\nRecent trade: $2,110.34 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-5-december-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no publicly available data indicating that Elon Musk has posted 500 or more tweets between December 5 and December 12, 2025. Recent reports suggest a decline in X (formerly Twitter) usage, with a 30% drop in daily active users from 2023 to 2024. ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/03/06/usage-of-elon-musks-x-dropped-30percent-in-the-last-year-study-suggests/?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, a study indicates that X has 251 million daily active users and 611 million monthly active users as of 2025. ([grabon.in](https://www.grabon.in/indulge/tech/twitter-statistics/?utm_source=openai)) These trends may influence Musk's tweeting behavior.\n\nIn the prediction market, the \"500+\" outcome has a 16.1% chance, suggesting a lower probability of Musk posting 500 or more tweets during this period. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-5-december-12/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-5-december-12-320-339...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"YES\" for Market 1 due to the legally mandated release deadline. For the Elon Musk tweet markets, there is notable disagreement on the specific 460-479 range, but a clear agreement to predict \"NO\" for the 500+ threshold. Overall, the predictions favor a legal outcome being met but show caution around precise behavioral metrics without definitive real-time data.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: The Epstein Files Transparency Act mandates the release of all unclassified documents by December 19, 2025, and recent developments indicate that judicial approvals are in place to support this. Therefore, it is highly likely that the documents will be released as required by this law.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While there is significant trading volume and historical data showing Musk can tweet at high volumes, there is insufficient specific data confirming he will post exactly within the 460-479 range. The lack of precise current data makes it difficult to confidently bet on this specific range.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Recent reports indicate no publicly available data showing that Elon Musk has posted 500 or more tweets during the specified period. Additionally, a noted decline in X's user activity might suggest a decrease in Musk's tweeting frequency, supporting a bet against the 500+ tweets outcome.",

Federal judges have already authorized release of grand jury transcripts, indicating compliance is on track.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is a very narrow range (460-479 tweets) over an 8-day period that has likely already concluded or is nearly complete. Without knowing the current count, the specific bucket is too uncertain to trade confidently.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The 500+ outcome shows only 16.1% probability in the market, and while Musk has historically posted heavily (averaging ~106/day in peak periods), the specific threshold of 500+ in 8 days (~63/day minimum) combined with recent trading activity heavily favoring \"No\" suggests this threshold won't be met.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: The Epstein Files Transparency Act legally mandates the DOJ to release unclassified documents by December 19, 2025, and federal judges have already authorized the release of grand jury transcripts. The legal framework is in place for compliance with the deadline.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Musk has shown high posting frequency (averaging ~106 posts/day in Nov 2024), the 460-479 range is extremely specific (only 20-tweet window over 8 days, or ~57-60 tweets/day). Without real-time data on his current posting rate during this exact period, this is too narrow to predict confidently.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: 500+ tweets over 8 days requires 62.5+ tweets per day consistently. Recent trade of $2,110 on No and the market showing only 16.1% probability suggests this threshold is unlikely. Historical data shows ~106/day during peak periods, but sustained rates above 62.5/day for a full week are less common.",
