  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for Barcelona in Market 3, with four AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade due to superior form. For Market 2, most analysts agree the 96% price is overconfident, recommending \"NO\" due to execution risk and a 2026 timeline. Market 1 shows the most disagreement, with a split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE\" calls, reflecting uncertainty in balancing Sheffield's form against West Brom's home advantage.",
