  "consensus_summary": "The consensus is unanimous that Market 1 will resolve to \"NO\" and Market 2 to \"YES,\" as both are considered settled based on definitive news of NAVI's elimination and Phantom's already-achieved revenue. For Market 3, there is a split between predicting \"YES\" for the Jaguars covering the spread and advising \"NO_TRADE,\" with disagreement centering on the reliability of a large NFL point spread. Overall, the first two markets are viewed as high-confidence predictions, while the third is seen as speculative and risky.",

The uncertainty surrounding the Jets' performance and potential variability in outcomes advises caution, making this a no-trade situation.",

The Jets showed competitiveness with a rookie QB debut, and NFL games rarely see such large margins covered consistently, making this a risky bet on either side.",

The market condition has already been met.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the Jaguars have strong recent form (4-game win streak, 9-4 record) against a struggling Jets team (3-10), a 13.5-point spread is extremely large in the NFL. The recent $3,048.50 bet on Jets suggests sharp money may see value in the underdog, making this spread too uncertain to confidently back either side.",
