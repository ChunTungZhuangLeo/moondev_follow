However, with players returning from injury and no significant injury issues for Everton, it is uncertain if they will surpass the 2.5 goals threshold. The mixed indicators and recent bet on Over make this too uncertain to confidently predict.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Andr\u00e9 Ventura's earlier withdrawal in March 2025 and subsequent re-entry in September indicates instability in his candidacy. Combined with the recent trade favoring \"No,\" his prospects seem weakened, making a bet against his win a logical choice.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Jo\u00e3o Cotrim Figueiredo's campaign emphasizes optimism and youth, appealing potentially to a significant voter base, but there is insufficient information on his current standing in the race or public support to confidently predict his chances against other candidates. Without clearer insights into his electoral strength, a neutral stance is advisable.",
