However, OpenAI's recent release of GPT-5.2, which boasts improved general intelligence and coding capabilities, indicates strong competition in the AI field. Additionally, Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think is currently available exclusively to AI Ultra subscribers, limiting its widespread accessibility. Given these developments, while Google's AI model is highly advanced, the competitive landscape suggests that it may not hold the top position by the end of December 2025.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in AI Models:\n- [OpenAI launches GPT-5.2 after 'code red' push to counter Google's Gemini 3](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-launches-gpt-52-ai-model-with-improved-capabilities-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, December 11\n- [Gemini 3 Deep Think is Google's 'most advanced...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Arsenal FC vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers FC: O/U 2.5\nRecent trade: $609.12 on Under\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/epl-ars-wol-2025-12-13-more-markets\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\n\n## EPL Schedule\n- Wolverhampton Wanderers @ Arsenal FC on Saturday, Dec 13, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST\n\n\nArsenal FC is set to host Wolverhampton Wanderers FC at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, December 13, 2025.

To assess the likelihood of this outcome, consider the following recent developments:\n\n**Team Form and Recent Results:**\n\n- **Recent Matches:** Chelsea has experienced a dip in form, going winless in their last four matches. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/palmer-fofana-available-everton-clash-chelsea-look-consistency-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai)) This includes a 3-1 defeat to Leeds United and a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts NO for Market 1 (Google's AI) due to OpenAI's competitive GPT-5.2 release and Gemini's limited accessibility. For Market 3 (Chelsea spread), all models agree on NO, citing Chelsea's poor form and key injuries. There is a split on Market 2 (Arsenal game Over/Under), with two models predicting YES based on team strength disparity, while one model recommends NO_TRADE due to recent mixed results and market sentiment.",

The limitations in accessibility of Google's model also factor into this uncertainty, making it difficult to decisively bet on Google's model being the top by the end of December 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Arsenal's strong goal-scoring record and Wolverhampton's poor defensive performance suggest a high likelihood of more than 2.5 goals being scored. Arsenal's recent 3-0 victory in the Champions League further supports the potential for a high-scoring game.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Chelsea's current winless streak and the absence of key striker Liam Delap due to injury reduce the likelihood of them winning by at least two goals against Everton. These factors point towards a closer game, making the spread of Chelsea (-1.5) an unattractive bet.",
