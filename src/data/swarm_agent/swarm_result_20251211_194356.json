      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Given the recent form of both teams, with Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC securing three consecutive wins and Rangers FC remaining unbeaten in their last five games, it suggests a competitive match, but the recent trades and team performance lean towards a win for one of the teams, making a draw less likely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: With Elon Musk confirming reports of a potential SpaceX IPO and valuation estimates targeting between $800 billion and $1.5 trillion, it's plausible that SpaceX's market cap could exceed $1 trillion at market close on IPO day, especially considering the plans to raise over $25 billion.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: President Trump's indication that he has decided on a candidate and the mention of an impending announcement, coupled with Treasury Secretary's comment on a \"very good chance\" of the announcement before Christmas, suggests that Kevin Hassett, being a leading contender, might indeed be the nominee for the next Fed Chair.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC has a strong recent form with multiple wins, while Rangers FC has been resilient with several draws. This suggests both teams are capable of achieving a result other than a draw, but the draw still remains a plausible outcome given Rangers' recent performances. The uncertainty makes this market hard to predict confidently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although SpaceX is considering an IPO with a target valuation that could exceed $1 trillion, the range provided ($800 billion to $1.5 trillion) introduces significant uncertainty. Without a confirmed IPO date or more concrete information, the valuation could fall short of $1 trillion, making it risky to predict with confidence.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Kevin Hassett is mentioned as a leading contender for the Fed Chair position, and recent comments from President Trump and the Treasury Secretary suggest an imminent announcement. Given these indications, the probability of Hassett's nomination appears strong, justifying a bet on \"Yes\".",

Historical head-to-head shows Rangers winning decisively (4-0). Draws typically have ~25% probability, and the recent $864.77 trade on No suggests market sentiment aligns with a decisive result.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES**\nReasoning: SpaceX is targeting a valuation between $800B-$1.5T for its IPO with plans to raise over $25B. The midpoint of this range exceeds $1T, and given strong investor demand for SpaceX shares in secondary markets and Musk's confirmation of IPO plans, reaching $1T on IPO day is plausible given the projected revenue growth to $15B in 2025.\n\n**MARKET 3: YES**\nReasoning: Recent news indicates Hassett is the leading contender, Trump has stated he's made his decision, and Treasury Secretary Bessent suggests an announcement before Christmas. The large recent trade of $9,589.87 on Yes reflects strong market confidence that Hassett will be nominated, consistent with reporting from major outlets.",

The contrasting styles and Rangers' draw tendency make this outcome uncertain, and the recent $864 bet on No suggests the market may already be efficiently priced.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: SpaceX is reportedly targeting a valuation between $800B-$1.5T for its IPO, with Musk confirming IPO reports as accurate. Given the company's strong revenue trajectory ($15B in 2025, projected $30B+ by 2027) and the high end of their target range exceeding $1T, there's a reasonable probability the market cap closes above $1T on IPO day.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Trump has confirmed he's decided on Powell's successor with announcement expected by Christmas, and multiple sources identify Hassett as the leading contender. The recent $9,589 bet on Yes and Treasury Secretary Bessent's confidence in a pre-Christmas announcement suggest Hassett is the frontrunner, making this a favorable position.",
