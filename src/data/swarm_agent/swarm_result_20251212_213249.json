However, the market price is already quite high, and the probability of it being dethroned seems less than 15%, making this a no-trade scenario.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 70%  \nMarket Price: 62.0%  \nEdge: +8% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: 8 \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Leverkusen's strong head-to-head record against K\u00f6ln and their decent performance in the Champions League suggest they have a good chance of winning.

(December 16, 2025)**\n\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -3.8%\nExpected Value: Minimal (not actionable)\nReasoning: Despite the 60% viewership drop in week 2, Stranger Things 5 remains Netflix's biggest show with no major competing releases this week. The decline is normal for streaming debuts, and it should still comfortably hold #1. However, the 95.8% price already reflects this near-certainty.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 62%\nEdge: +10%\nExpected Value: +10% \u00d7 ~1.6 payout = ~16% EV\nReasoning: Leverkusen at home against K\u00f6ln (historically dominated 4-1 in last 5 H2H) with defending champions quality. The Augsburg loss was an anomaly; Grimaldo is back and scored vs Newcastle. K\u00f6ln is a significantly weaker opponent than Augsburg. Home advantage at BayArena is substantial. Market seems to be overweighting the single Augsburg defeat.\n\n**Decision: YES**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Partizan vs. KK Crvena Zvezda**\n\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 74% (for Crvena Zvezda)\nEdge: -6%\nExpected Value: Insufficient\nReasoning: The market shows 74% for Crvena Zvezda, but Partizan won the most recent H2H 89-77 and plays at home at Belgrade Arena. Derby matches are inherently volatile. Crvena Zvezda is generally the stronger EuroLeague team this season, but 74% seems slightly high given home court advantage and derby unpredictability.

The market resolves for week of Dec 16, which is week 4 post-release. Historical patterns show continued viewership decline after week 2, and new releases typically challenge aging shows. The 95.8% price is too high, but not enough edge to bet NO.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (13% edge on home favorite)\nReasoning: Leverkusen has won 4 of last 5 head-to-head matches against K\u00f6ln and is playing at home (BayArena). Despite the recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg, K\u00f6ln is a weaker opponent than top Bundesliga sides. The recent draw vs Newcastle shows resilience. Home advantage plus historical dominance makes 75% probability reasonable vs 62% market price.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 60%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -14.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: The market is pricing Crvena Zvezda at 74% (assuming this is Zvezda's win probability), but Partizan won the most recent matchup 89-77 in November 2024, and this game is at Partizan's home arena (Belgrade Arena). Derby matches are typically closer than 74-26 splits. Potential coaching changes at Partizan add uncertainty, but home court advantage in this intense rivalry suggests closer to 60-40, making the NO bet (on Zvezda at 74%) valuable.",
