Bannon, who was pardoned by Trump on January 19, 2021, for federal charges related to the \"We Build the Wall\" campaign, has since faced state-level legal challenges. In February 2025, Bannon pleaded guilty to state charges in New York, resulting in a three-year conditional discharge without jail time. ([wlrn.org](https://www.wlrn.org/npr-breaking-news/2025-02-12/trump-ally-steve-bannon-pleads-guilty-and-avoids-jail-time-in-border-wall-fraud-case?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite the federal pardon, Bannon's state conviction remains intact, and there is no indication that Trump intends to intervene in state legal matters. Additionally, prediction markets have shown a decline in the likelihood of a 2025 pardon for Bannon, with odds dropping from 33% to 6% following other recent pardons.
