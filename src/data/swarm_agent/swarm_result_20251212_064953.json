For Markets 1 and 3, opinions are mixed and converge on \"NO TRADE,\" as the estimated true probabilities are too close to the market prices to meet the 10% edge threshold. The primary disagreement lies in the exact edge calculations, but the directional consensus on tradable vs. non-tradable markets is strong.",

Market slightly overvalues home team. Not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -94.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive on NO side\nReasoning: Lighter raised funds at $1.5B valuation. Even with 10x pump on launch day, reaching $10B+ FDV would be extraordinary.

Home advantage roughly balances out the injury concerns, making this close to a coin flip with slight home edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -94.1% (3% - 97.1%)\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side (94.1% edge \u00d7 ~34.5x payout)\nReasoning: The market shows 97.1% YES but the search results indicate only 2.1% chance on Polymarket itself, suggesting the displayed price is inverted or there's confusion. Lighter raised at $1.5B valuation; reaching $10B FDV would require 6.7x jump on day one, which is extremely unlikely even in crypto.
