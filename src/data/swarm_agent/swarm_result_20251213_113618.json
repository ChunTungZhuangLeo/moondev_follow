  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows agreement that Market 3's 96% price is vastly overstated, with all models assigning Mainz a low (~10%) true probability, creating a strong unanimous case for a 'NO' trade. For Markets 1 and 2, opinions diverge on whether the edge is sufficient, but all agree the true probabilities for Magdeburg and Alanyaspor are at or below the market prices, discouraging 'YES' bets. The only trade with a clear, significant edge across the analysis is betting against Mainz in Market 3.",
