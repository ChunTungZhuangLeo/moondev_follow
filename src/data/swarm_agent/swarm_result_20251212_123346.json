  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge to bet against Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas winning, with most models assigning a true probability far below the 21% market price. There is significant disagreement on the Venezuela military engagement market, with estimates ranging from 25% to 85%, indicating high uncertainty. For the Fed Chair nomination, opinions are split between seeing no trade and a bet against, though all agree the 74% market price is at or above the reasonable true probability.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 10%\nMarket Price: 21.0%\nEdge: -11% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$0.11 per $1 wagered\nReasoning: Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas has not declared his candidacy and has endorsed Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, suggesting his candidacy is unlikely. The commitment to support Bolsonaro further diminishes his probability of running, let alone winning.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$0.04 per $1 wagered\nReasoning: Although Kevin Hassett is a leading candidate and has expressed willingness to serve, there is still some uncertainty as no official nomination has been made.

The probability is close to the market price, offering insufficient edge for a trade.",

      "response": "# Polymarket Market Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 21%\nEdge: -6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Tarc\u00edsio has publicly endorsed Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro's candidacy and hasn't declared himself. With Bolsonaro's son now \"irreversibly\" running, Tarc\u00edsio would split the conservative vote if he ran. The 21% market price seems roughly fair given the uncertainty around his February decision.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 74%\nEdge: -19% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +19% on NO side\nReasoning: While Trump called Hassett \"potential\" Fed Chair and Hassett expressed willingness, Jerome Powell's term doesn't end until May 2026. Trump has floated many names publicly without following through. The market is overpricing speculative comments - 74% is far too high for an unofficial nomination that may not materialize.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 64.3%\nEdge: -39.3% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +39% on NO side\nReasoning: Despite escalated tensions and naval deployments, the U.S. operations are explicitly framed as counter-narcotics missions, not military engagement with Venezuela. The airstrikes targeted drug traffickers, not Venezuelan military assets. Direct U.S.-Venezuela military conflict by January 31 (7 weeks away) would require a dramatic escalation beyond current posturing. Market is massively overpricing war probability.",

With Fl\u00e1vio's \"irreversible\" decision to run and Tarc\u00edsio's support for him, it appears Tarc\u00edsio will not be the right-wing candidate. Even if he ran, winning requires beating both Lula and potentially splitting the conservative vote.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump nominate Kevin Hassett as the next Fed chair?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -4% (70% - 74%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: While Hassett is clearly a leading candidate with Trump's public hints and Hassett's willingness to serve, the nomination hasn't happened yet and Trump is known for last-minute changes. The market seems reasonably priced at 74%, perhaps slightly high given Trump's unpredictability, but not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: US x Venezuela military engagement by January 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 64.3%\nEdge: -19.3% (45% - 64.3%)\nExpected Value: 19.3% \u00d7 0.54 = 10.4% return on NO bet\nReasoning: While tensions are elevated with naval deployments and airstrikes on drug traffickers, these operations target criminal organizations, not Venezuelan military forces directly. A formal military engagement between US and Venezuelan forces within ~7 weeks would be a major escalation. The market appears to be overpricing the probability of direct state-to-state military conflict versus anti-drug operations.",
