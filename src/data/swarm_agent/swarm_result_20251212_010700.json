  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for both the Game Awards audio design market, due to Ghost of Y\u014dtei's prior win, and for Kash Patel leaving, citing Trump's public support. For the NHL over/under market, opinions are split between \"No\" and \"No Trade,\" reflecting uncertainty from strong goaltending and mixed offensive signals. Overall, the group shows high agreement on two markets but caution on the sports prediction due to conflicting defensive and offensive indicators.",

This suggests \"Ghost of Y\u014dtei\" may have a better chance at The Game Awards as well.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite reports suggesting potential removal, President Trump has publicly supported Kash Patel, reducing the likelihood of his departure.
