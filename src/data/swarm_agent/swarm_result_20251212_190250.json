Recent analyses and statistics support this expectation:\n\n- **Recent Form**: Angers SCO has been in solid form, securing three wins and two losses in their last five matches, including a 1-0 away victory over Nice. In contrast, FC Nantes has struggled, remaining winless in their last five games with two draws and three defeats, including losses to Lyon and Lens.

As of December 12, 2025, the market indicates an 11% chance that Lighter's FDV will exceed $6 billion one day post-launch. This is a decrease from the 14% probability observed on December 9, 2025, and the 7% probability on December 8, 2025. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/market/lighter-market-cap-fdv-6b-one-day-after-launch-324-746-197?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn terms of recent developments, Lighter announced a $68 million raise at a $1.5 billion valuation on November 11, 2025. ([kucoin.com](https://www.kucoin.com/news/insight/ETH/6913877454a807000792709d?utm_source=openai)) This valuation suggests a token price of approximately $37.5 per point, assuming a total supply of 40 million points. However, the FDV of $1.5 billion is significantly lower than the $6 billion threshold set in the prediction market.\n\nExpert...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Games Total: O/U 2.5\nRecent trade: $988.49 on Over\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/cs2-furia-navi-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe \"Over/Under 2.5 goals\" betting market is a popular wager in soccer, where bettors predict whether the total number of goals scored in a match will be over or under 2.5. Recent trends indicate a shift towards more matches ending with under 2.5 goals.\n\n**Recent Trends:**\n\n- **December 2025 Data:** In December, 55% of matches (20 games) have seen over 2.5 goals, while 45% have seen under 2.5 goals. This is a decrease from November, where over 2.5 goals occurred in 68.6% of matches. ([accaplanner.com](https://www.accaplanner.com/league/english-premier-league/over-under-goals/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **La Liga Specifics:** In Spain's La Liga, over 2.5 goals have been scored in 30.8% of games in December, down from 50% in November.

However, the market has seen significant trading on the Over, suggesting mixed sentiment. Given the conflicting signals, a NO_TRADE position is prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Lighter's recent $68 million raise at a $1.5 billion valuation suggests that the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is far below the $6 billion threshold set in the prediction market. The current market probability is only 11%, reflecting skepticism about reaching such a high FDV shortly after launch.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although there is a slight trend towards fewer matches ending with over 2.5 goals, the recent data shows a nearly even split between over and under outcomes. Without specific information about the teams playing in this match, it's difficult to make a confident prediction, so a NO_TRADE position is advisable.",

The market correctly prices this at only 11% probability.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (FURIA vs NAVI), not soccer, where best-of-3 series commonly go to 3 games between competitive teams. Both are quality teams, making a full 3-game series (Over 2.5) probable.",

This mismatch between the news and actual market makes it impossible to make an informed prediction.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Lighter recently raised $68M at a $1.5B valuation, which is 4x below the $6B threshold. The current market probability is only 11% and declining, and there's no indication of catalysts that would justify a 4x valuation jump within one day of launch.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news context discusses soccer Over/Under 2.5 goals betting, but the market link is for a CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) esports match between FURIA and NAVI. The \"Games Total\" likely refers to best-of-3 or best-of-5 map series in esports, making the soccer statistics completely irrelevant.",
