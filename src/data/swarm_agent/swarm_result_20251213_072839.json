There is notable disagreement on the soccer over/under markets, particularly for Arsenal vs. Wolves where assessments of value vary widely. A balanced summary is that only the Liverpool vs. Brighton market presents a potential edge, with two models suggesting opposing trades, indicating high uncertainty.",
