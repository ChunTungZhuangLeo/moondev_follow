Covering 8.5 points against even a weak Nets team is always uncertain. NBA spreads of this size historically cover around 50-52% of the time. No significant edge detected.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: LoL: Dplus KIA vs Hanwha Life Esports - Game 3 Winner**\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 75%\nEdge: +10% (85% - 75%)\nExpected Value: +10% \u00d7 0.33 = +3.3% return\nReasoning: The search results indicate Dplus KIA already won Game 3 decisively (25-11) with strong individual performances from Aiming and Viper. If this game has already been played and DK won, the true probability should be near 100%. The 75% price suggests the market hasn't fully updated to this result.

This is essentially a coin flip on whether they cover by more than half a point.
