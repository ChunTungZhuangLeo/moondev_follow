A major sticking point remains territorial concessions, particularly regarding Donbas. As a compromise, the U.S. has proposed the establishment of a \"free economic zone\" in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donbas, which Russia wants Ukraine to cede. Zelenskyy indicated this area could be demilitarized but said governance remains unclear, and any territorial concessions would require a public referendum.

Recent developments, however, suggest increasing international pressure and internal challenges that could influence his tenure.\n\n**International Pressure:**\n\n- **U.S. Actions:** On December 10, 2025, the United States seized the VLCC Skipper, a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela's coast, accusing it of transporting illicit oil. President Donald Trump described the vessel as the largest ever seized and suggested the U.S. would retain the oil aboard. Venezuela condemned the action as \"blatant theft\" and \"international piracy.\" ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Sanctions:** The U.S. has imposed sanctions on three of Maduro's nephews and several shipping companies linked to the regime, citing connections to drug traffi...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Counter-Strike: OG vs 500 (BO3)\nRecent trade: $1,255.72 on OG\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/cs2-og1-500-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nOG Esports is set to face Team 500 in a best-of-three (BO3) match during the CCT Season 3 European Series #12 on December 12, 2025.

([esportbet.com](https://esportbet.com/og-finalize-counter-strike-2-roster-with-fl4mus/?utm_source=openai))\n  - In October 2025, OG benched players Nicod \"nicoodoz\" Tamjidi and Christoffer \"Chr1zN\" Storgaard following their failure to qualify for the StarLadder Budapest Major. ([esportsinsider.com](https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/og-esports-nicoodoz-chr1zn-cs2-benching?utm_source=openai))\n  - In November 2025, OG signed Casper \"cadiaN\" M\u00f8ller, a seasoned in-game leader and AWPer, marking a new era for the team.

The recent U.S. actions and sanctions, while significant, do not directly indicate an imminent change in leadership.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: OG Esports has bolstered their team with key signings, including the experienced Casper \"cadiaN\" M\u00f8ller, and finalized their roster with Timur \"FL4MUS\" Marev. These strategic moves suggest they are well-prepared and likely to perform strongly against Team 500 in the upcoming match.",

With only ~3 weeks left in 2025, a formal ceasefire agreement is unlikely to materialize.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite significant international pressure including U.S. sanctions and seizure of oil tankers, Maduro has weathered similar pressures for years and there's no indication of imminent regime change. With less than 3 weeks remaining in 2025, his departure this year is highly improbable.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: OG has been actively rebuilding their roster with strong additions like cadiaN (experienced IGL/AWPer) and FL4MUS, suggesting improved competitiveness. Against Team 500, a lower-tier opponent, OG should be favored in this BO3 match given their recent roster investments and organizational resources.",

With only ~3 weeks left in 2025, a formal ceasefire agreement seems unlikely despite cautious progress.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite increased international pressure (U.S. oil tanker seizure, sanctions on regime members), there is no concrete evidence suggesting Maduro will step down in the remaining weeks of 2025. The recent U.S. actions appear to strengthen his defiant position rather than weaken it internally.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: OG has made significant roster changes (adding FL4MUS and cadiaN, benching nicoodoz and Chr1zN) which could improve performance, but these are very recent changes creating uncertainty about team chemistry. Without clear recent head-to-head results or current form data for both teams, this is too uncertain to predict confidently.",
