However, the market is already pricing this correctly at 97.8% NO (2.2% YES), leaving insufficient edge for a profitable trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Your Probability:** 65%\n**Market Price:** 53.0%\n**Edge:** +12.0%\n**Expected Value:** +12.0% \u00d7 $1.88 payout = +22.6% EV\n**Reasoning:** Panthers are favored by 2.5 points and getting key player Jaycee Horn back from concussion protocol strengthens their secondary. The 53% market price undervalues their chances of covering a small spread as road favorites against a struggling Saints team. Panthers' 7-6 record shows competitiveness.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Your Probability:** 8%\n**Market Price:** 93.0%\n**Edge:** -85.0% (8% - 93%)\n**Expected Value:** +85% \u00d7 $14.29 payout = +1214% EV on NO side\n**Reasoning:** Fartcoin currently trades at $0.3685 and would need to nearly DOUBLE (90% gain) in just 18 days to hit $0.7. Even bullish forecasts only predict $0.3997 by year-end. The recent whale accumulation and 37.7% monthly gain are already priced in. A 90% move in 18 days is extremely unlikely for a memecoin at this market cap. This is severely mispriced - the NO side offers exceptional value.",

Given no news of any token launch with only 18 days remaining, and the search confirming no announcements exist, the true probability of a launch is extremely low (~5%). If the market truly prices YES at 97.8%, this is massively mispriced.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. The market price shown is 97.8% which likely represents the NO side being priced at 97.8%. This aligns with the search results. In that case:\n\nMARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 95%\nMarket Price: 97.8% (NO implied)\nEdge: -2.8%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Market correctly prices this as highly unlikely (~2-5% chance of YES). With no announcements and 18 days left, the market is fairly priced. Not enough edge.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Spread: Panthers (-2.5)**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 53.0%\nEdge: -3%\nExpected Value: Low\nReasoning: Panthers are 7-6 and favored by 2.5 on the road against the Saints. Hubbard's injury status (day-to-day with calf) is concerning for their run game. Road favorites covering against divisional opponents is historically around 50%. The 53% price seems reasonable given the matchup dynamics.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Fartcoin hit $0.7 by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 93.0%\nEdge: -78% (betting NO)\nExpected Value: High on NO side\nReasoning: Current price is ~$0.37, needing a 90% gain in 18 days to hit $0.70. Price predictions show only $0.40 by year end. While crypto is volatile, nearly doubling in under 3 weeks with no catalyst is unlikely. The 93% YES price seems wildly mispriced - the $1,000 NO trade suggests smart money agrees.\n\nWait - the 93% likely represents NO probability, not YES. Let me recalculate:\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 10%\nMarket Price: 7% YES (93% NO)\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Low\nReasoning: If market prices YES at 7%, this seems about right. Fartcoin would need to nearly double from $0.37 to $0.70 in 18 days - possible but unlikely. Market is fairly priced.",
