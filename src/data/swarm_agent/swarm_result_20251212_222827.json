Recent developments and statistics provide insight into this matchup:\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** In their last game on December 7, 2025, the 76ers narrowly lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, 112-108.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from December 3 to 8, 2025, reported his approval rating at 41%, up from 38% in late November. This uptick is attributed to growing Republican support for his focus on cost-of-living issues, such as scaling back tariffs and addressing high food prices. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-approval-rating-rises-republicans-back-cost-of-living-efforts-2025-12-09/?utm_source=openai))\n\nSimilarly, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released on December 8, 2025, indicated a 3-point increase in Trump's approval rating, bringing it to 47%. This improvement is reflected across various policy areas, including crime and economic concerns. ([harvardharrispoll.com](https://harvardharrispoll.com/press-release-december-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, other polls have reported lower approval ratings.

Recent developments provide insight into his potential candidacy:\n\n**Official Announcements:**\n- In October 2025, Newsom confirmed his consideration of a presidential bid, stating, \"Yeah, I'd be lying if I said otherwise.\" He indicated that a decision would follow the 2026 midterm elections. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/gavin-newsom-2028-presidential-race?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Polls and Surveys:**\n- An Emerson College Polling survey from August 2025 showed Newsom leading the Democratic field with 25% support, a significant increase from 12% in June. ([emersoncollegepolling.com](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/august-2025-national/?utm_source=openai))\n- A Yahoo/YouGov poll released in December 2025 found Newsom at 21% support among Democratic voters, ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris at 19%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Trump's approval rating will hit 40% in 2025 (YES), as polls already show it above that threshold. For the 76ers spread, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" reflecting uncertainty due to the 76ers' struggles versus the Pacers' momentum. Regarding Newsom, there is notable disagreement, with predictions split between \"YES,\" \"NO,\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" highlighting the high uncertainty of a 2028 nomination despite his current lead in polls.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The 76ers are favored to win by 5.5 points, but their recent performance, particularly Joel Embiid's struggles, coupled with the Pacers' recent improvement, makes this a close call. The uncertainty surrounding both teams' performances suggests avoiding a position.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Recent polls, including a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing Trump at 41% and a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll at 47%, indicate a trend of increasing approval ratings. Given this upward trajectory, betting that Trump's approval rating will hit at least 40% in 2025 seems reasonable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Gavin Newsom is a leading contender, with strong polling numbers and consideration for a presidential bid, the 2028 nomination is still far off, and many variables could affect his chances. The current landscape suggests caution in taking a position.",

A 5.5 point spread seems too large given Philadelphia's inconsistency.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Trump's approval rating has already hit 41% per Reuters/Ipsos (December 3-8, 2025) and 47% per Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, meaning the 40% threshold has already been reached in 2025. This should resolve YES.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Newsom leading early polls at 21-25%, the 2028 nomination is nearly 3 years away with many potential candidates. The $13,000 bet on No reflects smart money recognizing the uncertainty, and historically early frontrunners often don't secure nominations.",

A 5.5-point spread favoring Philly seems too generous given current form, but the uncertainty makes this not worth trading.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Trump's approval rating has already hit 41% in the Reuters/Ipsos poll (December 3-8) and 47% in the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll (December 8). The market asks if it will hit 40% in 2025, which has demonstrably already occurred.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While Newsom leads current polls at 21-25%, a $13,000 bet on \"No\" suggests the market may be overpricing his chances. The 2028 race is still 3+ years away, and Democratic primaries are notoriously unpredictable with many potential candidates who haven't emerged yet.",
