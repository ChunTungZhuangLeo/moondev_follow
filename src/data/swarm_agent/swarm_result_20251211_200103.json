  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for Avatar 3 being 2025's third highest-grossing film, citing its late December release as a major handicap, and unanimously predicts \"Yes\" for Lighter's market cap exceeding $2B and \"No\" for a Salzburg win. The only minor disagreement is on Avatar 3's specific reasoning, with some focusing on competition and others solely on its limited 2025 run. Overall, the AI models show high agreement across all three markets based on the provided timelines, financial metrics, and team form.",

Without information on other contenders, it's premature to assume it will be the third highest grossing movie.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Lighter's significant funding and high trading volume, surpassing $11 billion, suggest strong investor interest and platform activity. The high valuation and comparison to leading exchanges indicate the potential for its market cap to exceed $2 billion shortly after launch.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: SC Freiburg's strong recent form and FC Red Bull Salzburg's struggles in European fixtures make it likely that SC Freiburg will win the upcoming match, reducing the likelihood of a Salzburg victory.",
