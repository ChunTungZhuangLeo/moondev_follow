Arsenal's recent home matches have averaged 3 goals, and Wolverhampton's -25 goal difference indicates vulnerability to conceding multiple goals.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Despite Chelsea's recent struggles, the availability of key players like Cole Palmer and Wesley Fofana boosts their attacking potential. Everton's inconsistent form and the low odds for over 1.5 goals further imply a likelihood of multiple goals in the match.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: FC Barcelona's potent attack, with 47 goals in 16 matches, and their unbeaten home record make it highly likely they will score more than 1.5 goals against Osasuna, who are significant underdogs. The return of key offensive players enhances Barcelona's scoring chances.",

Chelsea has key players Palmer and Fofana returning from injury and will be motivated to end their four-match winless streak at home against an Everton side they should dominate offensively.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Barcelona leads La Liga with 47 goals scored (best attack in the league), has won 6 consecutive league matches, and maintains an unbeaten 7-match home record. With Raphinha and Pedri back from injury and facing mid-table Osasuna, over 1.5 goals is highly probable given their offensive firepower.",
