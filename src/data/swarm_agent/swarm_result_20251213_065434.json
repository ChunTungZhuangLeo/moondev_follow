  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong buy opportunity for Market 2 (Arsenal/Wolves Over 2.5 goals) due to a significant undervaluation, with edges estimated between +15% and +20%. For Markets 1 and 3, the analyses agree there is no actionable trade, though they slightly disagree on whether Mendoza's Heisman probability is perfectly priced or slightly over/undervalued. Overall, the only clear, unified recommendation is a YES trade on Market 2, as it meets the 10%+ edge threshold.",
