However, recent developments suggest potential shifts in Iran's leadership structure.\n\nIn June 2025, during the Iran-Israel conflict, Khamenei reportedly named three potential successors to ensure a swift transition of power. This decision was influenced by the ongoing war and concerns over his safety, as he was believed to be sheltering in a bunker amid threats of assassination by Israel.

([aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/6/flavio-bolsonaro-enters-brazils-2026-presidential-race-with-fathers-nod?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent polling data indicates that President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva holds a significant lead over Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro in a potential runoff scenario. A Datafolha poll released on December 8, 2025, shows Lula leading with 51% to Fl\u00e1vio's 36%.

UMBC averages 75.5 PPG and allows 71.6 - combined that's roughly 147 points per game pace, right at the line. The recent $3K bet on Under suggests sharp money sees value there, but the edge isn't sufficient for a confident trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Khamenei out as Supreme Leader of Iran by March 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 93.9% (implied NO at 6.1%)\nEdge: Wait - market shows 93.9% for YES which seems inverted.

He remains firmly in control, recently making defiant statements about US relations. The 93.9% YES price appears to be a market error or manipulation - betting NO is extremely high value.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro win the 2026 Brazilian presidential election?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 15.1%\nEdge: -3.1%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Datafolha shows Lula leading 51-36% in a runoff scenario.

However, Army typically plays slower tempo military academy basketball. The 146.5 line is tight, and recent $3k bet on Under suggests sharp money agrees. Army's defensive style likely pushes this under, but edge is insufficient for trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge under 10% threshold\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Khamenei out as Supreme Leader of Iran by March 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 93.9% (NO is priced at 6.1%)\nEdge: +1.9% betting NO side (or -85.9% on YES side shown)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO\n\n**CRITICAL ERROR IN MARKET PRICING**: This market shows 93.9% but that appears to be the NO probability. The actual question is whether he'll be OUT by March 31.\n\nReasoning: Khamenei naming successors in June 2025 during conflict is contingency planning, not resignation. No credible reports of terminal illness or imminent departure. 85-year-old dictators rarely leave voluntarily. Historical precedent shows Supreme Leaders serve until death. March 31 is only 3.5 months away - extremely unlikely timeline for regime change without coup or death.\n\n**Decision: YES** (betting NO - that he stays in power) - Market severely mispriced if 93.9% represents YES probability\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Will Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro win the 2026 Brazilian presidential election?**\n\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 15.1%\nEdge: -10.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive on NO side\nReasoning: Datafolha poll (Dec 8, 2025) shows Lula crushing Fl\u00e1vio 51% to 36% in runoff. Fl\u00e1vio lacks his father's charisma and carries family baggage without the benefit. His father is politically banned, limiting campaign effectiveness. 15.1% market price seems 3x too high given current polling deficit and 18-month runway.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Market overvalues Fl\u00e1vio's chances by ~10%",
