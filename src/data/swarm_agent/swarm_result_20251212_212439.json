The presence of other finalists suggests uncertainty, making it difficult to confidently predict the outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Despite the Iona Gaels' strong road performance, St. John's Red Storm has the home advantage and a better ranking as the No. 22 team. This, coupled with their recent victory against Ole Miss, suggests they are likely to win the upcoming game.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The 76ers' inconsistent performance against the spread and the Pacers' recent improvement make this a challenging market to predict. Given the close previous game results and uncertainty around key players' performances, it's prudent to avoid taking a position.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Waller is confirmed as a finalist alongside Hassett and Warsh, there's no clear indication Trump will choose him specifically. With three strong contenders and no definitive signal, this is too uncertain to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: St. John's is ranked #22, playing at home at Madison Square Garden where they're 4-1, and facing an unranked Iona team. The home court advantage and ranking difference strongly favor St. John's covering.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The 76ers are struggling with Joel Embiid shooting poorly (4-of-21 in their last game) and just lost to the Lakers, while the Pacers have won two straight and are improving. A 3.5-point first-half spread favoring Philadelphia seems too generous given their inconsistent form.",

Despite Iona's decent 8-3 record, the talent gap and home court advantage strongly favor St. John's.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The 76ers have been inconsistent (5-5 in last 10, 4-6 ATS) and Embiid's recent shooting struggles (4-21) raise concerns about covering a first-half spread, while the Pacers are gaining momentum with consecutive wins. This is too close to call confidently.",
