The large contrarian bet on a Metz win is unanimously viewed as irrational against the overwhelming evidence.",

PSG's strong form and perfect head-to-head record against Metz make a draw highly unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: FC Metz is facing PSG, a team leading Ligue 1 and in strong form with a history of victories over Metz. Given Metz's poor league position and recent performance, it is very unlikely they will win against PSG.",
