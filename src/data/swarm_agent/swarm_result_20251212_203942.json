  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Markets 1 and 2 as likely having inverted prices, where the high \"Yes\" probabilities actually reflect the opponent's chance to win, creating a massive edge for betting \"No.\" Analysts unanimously recommend a \"No\" trade for Market 2 due to Wolves' terrible form against Arsenal, while Market 1 receives mixed \"No\" or \"No Trade\" calls due to structural uncertainty. For Market 3, opinions vary on the director's chances, resulting in no clear trade recommendation with a 10%+ edge.",

Cagliari's victory was aided by a red card, making their win less indicative of future performance.

Cagliari is playing AWAY at Atalanta (Serie A leaders/top contenders) at Gewiss Stadium. Atalanta at home against a mid-table Cagliari should be heavily favored. Cagliari's true win probability is around 15%.\n\n**Decision: NO** \u2705\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Wolverhampton Wanderers FC win on 2025-12-13?**\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 96.6%\nEdge: -93.6% (3% - 96.6%)\nExpected Value: Extremely high on NO side\n\nReasoning: Again, this market appears INVERTED. Wolves are BOTTOM of the Premier League, playing AWAY at Arsenal (league leaders) at Emirates Stadium. Wolves have lost 8 consecutive matches. Arsenal has won 7 of 8 home games with 6 clean sheets. Wolves' actual win probability is ~3%.\n\n**Decision: NO** \u2705\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Paul Thomas Anderson win Best Director at the 98th Academy Awards?**\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 85.0%\nEdge: -15% (70% - 85%)\nExpected Value: Moderate on NO side\n\nReasoning: While PTA is clearly the frontrunner with Gotham and NBR wins, 85% is too high this far from the ceremony.

      "response": "# Polymarket Market Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 15%\n**Market Price:** 90%\n**Edge:** -75% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Negative - would need to bet NO\n**Reasoning:** This market asks if Cagliari will WIN against Atalanta. Atalanta is heavily favored at home despite inconsistent form. Cagliari's recent win was against 10-man Roma. The 90% price appears to be asking \"Will Cagliari win?\" where the answer is clearly NO (they'll likely lose). However, the market structure is confusing - if this is truly asking about a Cagliari victory, the price should be ~10-20%, not 90%. Without clarity on market structure, this is NO_TRADE.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 5%\n**Market Price:** 96.6%\n**Edge:** -91.6% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong on NO side (Edge \u00d7 ~25x payout = significant EV)\n**Reasoning:** Wolves have lost 8 consecutive matches and sit bottom of the table, facing league-leading Arsenal at Emirates Stadium where Arsenal has won 7 of last 8 with 6 clean sheets. Wolves' 4-1 loss to Man United shows continued struggles. A Wolves victory would be a massive upset - true probability closer to 3-5%, making the 96.6% price still slightly overvalued but within reasonable bounds for such a mismatch.\n\n**Decision:** NO\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 82%\n**Market Price:** 85%\n**Edge:** -3% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Minimal negative value\n**Reasoning:** Anderson's \"One Battle After Another\" is sweeping precursor awards (Gotham Best Feature, NBR Best Film/Director) with strong critical acclaim and star performances. These early awards are highly predictive of Oscar success. However, 85% already prices in very high probability - historically, even frontrunners win Best Director 70-85% of the time after such momentum. The market is efficiently priced with only 3% edge either way.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n- **Recommended Trades:** Market 2 (NO on Wolves winning)\n- **Markets with <10% edge:** Markets 1 and 3\n- **Highest Conviction:** Market 2 - Wolves victory probability significantly overestimated even at 96.6%",
