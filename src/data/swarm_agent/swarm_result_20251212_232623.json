The ceasefire was brokered by the United States and Qatar, aiming to end the conflict that began in June 2025.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no trades with a 10%+ positive edge, as all models agree Market 1's probability is close to its price, resulting in minimal or negative edge. There is strong agreement that Market 2's \"Yes\" price is significantly overvalued, with most models recommending a \"No\" bet due to a perceived large negative edge. Finally, analysts uniformly view Market 3's \"Yes\" probability as too high, though they disagree on the magnitude of the overvaluation.",

However, the Jazz have been involved in high-scoring games recently. The edge isn't sufficient at -7.7% to recommend a NO bet, though I lean slightly under given the injury situation limiting Memphis's offense.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: China x Japan military clash before 2027?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 85.0%\nEdge: -60%\nExpected Value: Very high (betting NO at 15 cents for potential 85 cent return)\nReasoning: The 85% YES price seems drastically mispriced. While tensions are elevated with radar lock-on incidents and joint patrols, actual military clashes between two major powers with strong US alliance implications remain extremely rare. These are provocations and posturing, not precursors to imminent conflict.

Grizzlies have maintained strong record without Morant (7-3 in last 10), but his absence typically lowers pace. Jazz playing fast this season but struggling defensively. The 234.5 line is high, and with Edey out the game could be faster-paced, but Morant's questionable status creates uncertainty. Market price of 72.7% seems roughly appropriate given the injury situation.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only -4.7%, below the 10% threshold for confident action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**China x Japan military clash before 2027?**\n\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 85.0%\nEdge: -73.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: The December 6 radar lock-on incident is concerning but falls far short of an actual \"military clash.\" Both nations have strong economic interdependence and neither wants full conflict. Historical precedent shows dozens of similar incidents (2013 radar lock, repeated airspace incursions) that never escalated to actual clashes. The market is severely overreacting to recent tensions\u201485% implies near-certainty of military engagement within 25 months, which is extremely unlikely given diplomatic channels and mutual deterrence.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Market is drastically overpricing the probability of actual military clash. This represents exceptional value on the NO side with -73% edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Israel x Iran ceasefire broken by December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 97.7%\nEdge: -62.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Cannot calculate - market structure unclear\n\n**WAIT - CRITICAL ANALYSIS ERROR:**\n\nReading the context more carefully: The ceasefire was established June 24, 2025, and we're now at December 12, 2025. The context states \"both nations accused each other of violations\" but notes these were \"isolated\" and \"the ceasefire has largely held since then.\"\n\nThe 97.7% market price suggests the market believes the ceasefire has ALREADY been broken or will almost certainly break by December 31 (19 days away). However, the web search context indicates the ceasefire is still holding as of December 12, 2025.\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 97.7%\nEdge: -72.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: The ceasefire has held for nearly 6 months despite initial accusations. With only 19 days remaining until December 31, and the context explicitly stating the ceasefire \"has largely held,\" the 97.7% probability appears to be a severe overreaction. Either the market has information not in the search results, or it's dramatically mispricing based on past tensions rather than current stability.\n\n**Decision: NO** - The ceasefire has demonstrably NOT been broken as of December 12, and 19 days is a short window. Market at 97.7% is extremely overpriced.",
