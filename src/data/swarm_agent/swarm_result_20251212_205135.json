There is strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with all analysts recommending \"NO\" due to Sheffield United's superior form making a draw highly unlikely. The collective view suggests the only significant trading opportunity is betting against a draw in the football match.",

Sheffield United is on a 6-match unbeaten streak with 4 wins, just demolished Stoke 4-0 away, while West Brom has lost 3 straight without scoring. Historical draw rates in Championship are ~25-30%. Sheffield United should be heavy favorites to WIN, not draw. The 61.9% draw probability is absurdly high - this looks like a market error or manipulation.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 83.5%\nEdge: -3.5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Tate has legitimate kickboxing credentials and professional experience, while DeMoor is primarily a football player turned reality TV personality with limited boxing experience. However, DeMoor has significant size/athletic advantages. The 83.5% for Tate is reasonable given his combat sports background, but exhibition/influencer boxing can be unpredictable.

The market is slightly overvaluing OpenAI's position given competitive pressure, but not enough edge to trade. 19 days is significant time for competitors to release updates.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge insufficient (<10%)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61.9%\nEdge: -36.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: This market is severely mispriced. Sheffield United is on a 6-match unbeaten streak with 4 wins including a 4-0 away victory, while West Brom has lost 3 straight without scoring and just lost 1-3 at home. The form differential strongly favors Sheffield United winning outright, making a draw unlikely.

Limited information on DeMoor's actual boxing skills creates uncertainty. Market pricing seems approximately fair given available information - Tate should win but 83.5% feels roughly accurate.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge insufficient (<10%)\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n**Recommended Trade: Market 2 (West Brom vs Sheffield United Draw) - BET NO**\n\nThis is the only market with sufficient edge (36.9%). The form book strongly suggests Sheffield United should win outright, making the 61.9% draw probability dramatically overpriced. The recent $600 bet on NO suggests smart money may already be recognizing this mispricing.",
