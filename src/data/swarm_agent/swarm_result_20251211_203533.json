  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for a draw in Porto vs. Malm\u00f6, citing Porto's dominant home form and Malm\u00f6's poor away record. For the NHL over/under, most models predict \"Over\" 5.5 goals, noting both teams' recent high-scoring games, though one model dissented due to uncertainty. All analysts agree Lyon is unlikely to cover the -2.5 spread, pointing to their recent struggles, key departures, and offensive challenges.",

This makes a draw unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Both the Vegas Golden Knights and Philadelphia Flyers have shown an ability to score goals in their recent matches, with both teams having games that exceeded 5.5 goals. This trend suggests that betting on over 5.5 goals is a favorable outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Olympique Lyonnais has faced challenges, including a recent defeat and squad issues, which may affect their ability to cover a -2.5 goal spread. The recent trade on Go Ahead Eagles suggests skepticism about Lyon's ability to win by such a margin.",

This suggests a good chance for the total score to exceed 5.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Olympique Lyonnais recently lost 1-0, struggled with squad issues (red card), and their offense has been impacted by key forward departures. It is highly improbable they will win by a margin of 3 goals or more (-2.5 spread) given their current form.",

Porto should win this match comfortably.\n\nMARKET 2: Over\nReasoning: Recent games involving both teams have been high-scoring (Golden Knights 5-4 shootout loss, 4-1 win; Flyers 4-1 win), and Vegas's recent shootout loss to the Islanders shows games can be tight and high-scoring. Both teams appear capable of contributing to a 6+ goal total.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Lyon's recent struggles including a 1-0 loss to Lorient, key forward departures (Lacazette, Mikautadze), and squad issues make covering a -2.5 spread against Go Ahead Eagles unlikely. A 3+ goal margin is too ambitious given their current form.",

The recent trade of $710 on Over aligns with the offensive capabilities both teams have demonstrated, making 6+ total goals likely.\n\nMARKET 3: GO AHEAD EAGLES\nReasoning: Lyon is struggling with recent losses (1-0 to Lorient), has lost key forwards Lacazette and Mikautadze impacting their offense, and covering a -2.5 spread requires winning by 3+ goals. This is a very difficult spread to cover given their current form and squad issues.",
