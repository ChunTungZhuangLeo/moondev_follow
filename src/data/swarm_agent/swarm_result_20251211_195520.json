This confirms the bout is set to occur, supporting a \"Yes\" prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Kamala Harris has not declared her candidacy for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, and while she has shown openness to running, polling data presents a mixed picture. Her early lead in some polls does not provide enough certainty, making this a less clear opportunity for a definitive prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Similar to Market 2, Kamala Harris has not declared her candidacy for the 2028 U.S. presidential election, and the decline in her polling numbers indicates uncertainty. Without a clear indication of her candidacy or consistent high support, this market is too uncertain for a confident prediction.",

With nearly 3 years until the nomination and no official declaration, there's substantial uncertainty and strong competition from Newsom and Buttigieg.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Even if Harris wins the Democratic nomination, winning the general election requires clearing two hurdles with significant uncertainty. Her declining poll numbers, lack of official candidacy, and the inherent unpredictability of an election 3 years away make this a low-probability outcome.",

However, it's extremely early in the cycle with no official declarations, making this highly speculative with significant uncertainty.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Winning the general election requires first winning the Democratic nomination (which is uncertain per Market 2), then defeating the Republican candidate. Her declining poll numbers and the historical difficulty of Democrats winning three consecutive terms make this a low-probability outcome.",
