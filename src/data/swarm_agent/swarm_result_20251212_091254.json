However, prediction markets, particularly on Polymarket, have been actively tracking and forecasting his tweeting activity during this period.\n\nThe Polymarket event titled \"Elon Musk # tweets December 9 - December 16, 2025?\" has garnered significant attention, with a total volume of approximately $3 million. The market is structured into various tweet count ranges, each reflecting the probability of Musk's tweets falling within that range. For the 320-339 tweets range, the \"Yes\" outcome is priced at 7%, indicating a 7% chance that Musk will post between 320 and 339 tweets during this timeframe.

At 18, he's averaging 17.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.3 steals over 24 games, drawing comparisons to standout rookie campaigns by Victor Wembanyama and LeBron James. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/cooper-flaggs-breakout-rolls-mavericks-host-resurgent-nets--flm-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Injury Update:** Mavericks center Dereck Lively II will miss the remainder of the 2025-26 NBA season due to surgery on his right foot. Despite the setback, the team expects Lively to make a full recovery in time for the 2026-27 training camp.

They've secured victories in three of their last five matches, including two wins against Virtus.pro in October 2025. However, they've faced challenges against top-tier teams, suffering 0-2 losses to Tundra and Team Falcons. ([bo3.gg](https://bo3.gg/dota2/matches/mouz-dota2-vs-virtuspro-12-12-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Virtus.pro:** In contrast, Virtus.pro has struggled recently, achieving only one win in their last five matches. Their performance over the past six months reflects a 45% win rate, with a ranking of 23rd, indicating a decline in form.

For Market 2, opinions are split between a small edge for the Nets and no trade, indicating low confidence, while most agree Market 3's price for MOUZ is fair or slightly overvalued, offering no clear opportunity.

The market price seems to be heavily overvaluing the likelihood of Musk posting 320-339 tweets, with no specific news or data supporting such high activity.

The impact of Cooper Flagg and the absence of Dereck Lively for the Mavericks slightly increase the Nets' chances, but not significantly past the threshold needed for a trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 83.0%\nEdge: -8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -8% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: MOUZ is favored due to recent form and past victories against Virtus.pro, but the market price is already reflecting a high probability.

There appears to be a data error - the 91% likely represents NO probability. Given Musk's highly variable tweeting patterns and multiple tweet ranges being offered, any specific narrow range like 320-339 should have low probability (~5-10%). The actual market consensus supports ~7% for YES.\n\n**MARKET 2: Nets vs. Mavericks**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 22%\nMarket Price: 26%\nEdge: -4%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The Mavericks are at home with Cooper Flagg performing exceptionally well (17.3 PPG as a rookie). While they lost Dereck Lively II to season-ending surgery, Dallas remains the stronger team. The Nets are rebuilding and traveling. Market price of 26% for Nets seems roughly accurate, perhaps slightly generous to Brooklyn given the circumstances.\n\n**MARKET 3: Dota 2: MOUZ vs Virtus.pro (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 83%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: MOUZ has strong recent form (69% win rate) and has beaten Virtus.pro twice in October 2025. VP is struggling with only 1 win in last 5 matches and a 45% win rate over 6 months. However, MOUZ's losses to top teams and VP's potential for upset in BO3 format suggests 78-80% is more accurate than 83%. Edge insufficient to recommend NO bet.",

The context states the \"Yes\" outcome is priced at 7%, but you've listed the market price as 91%. If the true market price is 7%, then there's no edge. The 320-339 tweet range appears to be a tail outcome in a multi-outcome market. With Musk's typical posting patterns, this specific narrow range (20 tweets over 8 days = 40-42 tweets/day) is unlikely but the market seems appropriately priced at ~7% if that's the actual price.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Cannot assess edge due to conflicting price data.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Brooklyn Nets vs Dallas Mavericks**\n\nYour Probability: 38%\nMarket Price: 26.0%\nEdge: +12% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.46 units per dollar wagered\n\n**Reasoning:** The market is undervaluing the Nets at 26%. While Cooper Flagg is impressive, he's still a rookie. More critically, Dereck Lively II's season-ending injury significantly weakens Dallas's interior defense and rebounding. The Nets have been \"resurgent\" per the context, and getting them at 26% (3.85:1 odds) provides value when their true probability is closer to 35-40%.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Back the Nets at 26%.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**MOUZ vs Virtus.pro (Dota 2 BO3)**\n\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 83.0%\nEdge: -8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Slightly negative\n\n**Reasoning:** MOUZ has strong recent form (69% win rate, 2-0 head-to-head vs VP in October), while Virtus.pro is struggling (45% win rate, ranked 23rd, 1-5 in last matches). MOUZ should be favored around 70-75%, but the market at 83% is slightly overpricing them.
