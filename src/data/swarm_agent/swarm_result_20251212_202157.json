However, the return of Igor Zubeldia bolsters the defense. The absence of primary forwards may provide an opportunity for Jon Karrikaburu to partner with Kubo and Barrenetxea in attack.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's 72% draw probability as a likely mispricing, with most AIs estimating a true probability below 40%, but disagreements on whether this constitutes a tradable edge. For Market 2, all agree the 93% price for a Russian invasion is a severe overestimate, though probability estimates vary from 3% to 15%. Market 3 shows the most divergence, with estimates ranging from 50% to 65% for a Rizespor win, leading to mixed trade recommendations.",

Even with both teams having injury issues, a draw probability this high makes no sense statistically. Both teams have offensive capabilities despite absences, and Real Sociedad playing at home typically pushes for wins. This appears to be a massive mispricing or the market is structured differently than it appears.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Russia invade a NATO country by June 30, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 93% (Note: This seems inverted - the search says 9% chance of invasion, meaning 91% NO)\nEdge: Unclear due to apparent price confusion\nExpected Value: Cannot calculate reliably\nReasoning: The search context indicates Polymarket shows 9% chance of invasion (91% NO), but the listed market price shows 93%. If the market is pricing NO at 93%, this aligns with reality - Russia invading NATO would trigger Article 5 and potential nuclear escalation, making it extremely unlikely within 6 months despite heightened rhetoric. The true probability of invasion is around 3-7%.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will \u00c7aykur Rizespor win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 49%\nEdge: -14% (35% - 49%)\nExpected Value: 14% \u00d7 payout on NO = solid value\nReasoning: Rizespor's recent form is poor (1W-2D-2L in last 5), while Ey\u00fcpspor has better form (2W-2D-1L). Despite Rizespor having home advantage, their inconsistency and Ey\u00fcpspor's slightly better recent performances suggest Rizespor's win probability is closer to 35%, not 49%.

This appears to be a data error - draws in La Liga occur ~25% of the time historically. Both teams have injuries but Sociedad at home should be favored. However, the market pricing suggests confusion about what outcome is being traded.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market appears mispriced but the question framing is unclear enough to avoid.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 93%\nEdge: -90% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive on NO side (90% edge)\nReasoning: The market shows 93% probability but context indicates only 9% chance according to Polymarket itself. Despite NATO warnings, Russia is deeply engaged in Ukraine with no capacity for NATO conflict by June 2026. A NATO invasion would trigger Article 5 and global war - extremely unlikely in 6-month timeframe.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Massive edge exists. Russia lacks military capacity and political incentive for NATO invasion while Ukraine conflict continues.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 49%\nEdge: -4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal negative\nReasoning: Rizespor at home (12th place, 15 pts) vs Ey\u00fcpspor (16th place, 13 pts). Recent form shows Ey\u00fcpspor slightly better (2W-2D-1L vs 1W-2D-2L). Home advantage worth ~5-8%, making this a coin flip. Market price of 49% is approximately fair.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge under 10% threshold. Market efficiently priced for evenly-matched Turkish S\u00fcper Lig fixture.",
