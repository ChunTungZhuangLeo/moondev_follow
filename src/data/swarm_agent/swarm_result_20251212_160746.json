Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. Joel Embiid struggled offensively, shooting 4-of-21 for 16 points.

Despite initial claims of strong demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe Trump Gold Card program was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to replace the existing EB-5 visa program, which required investments tied to job creation. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected that selling one million Gold Cards could generate $5 trillion for the U.S. government.

However, recent developments indicate increasing international pressure and internal challenges that could influence his tenure.\n\n**International Sanctions and Diplomatic Tensions**\n\nOn December 11, 2025, the United States imposed new sanctions targeting three nephews of First Lady Cilia Flores and six oil tankers associated with Maduro's administration. The U.S. Treasury accused these entities of facilitating deceptive practices and supporting a \"corrupt narco-terrorist regime.\" This move coincided with a significant U.S. military buildup in the southern Caribbean, signaling a strategic shift in U.S. policy toward Venezuela.

This is essentially a coin flip spread bet with no meaningful edge either direction.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -62%\nExpected Value: 62% \u00d7 ~$0.15 = ~$0.09 per dollar risked\nReasoning: The news explicitly states the program was launched and Commerce Secretary Lutnick claimed \"$5 billion raised in a day by selling 1000 gold cards\" in March 2025. Even if sales were \"underwhelming\" vs projections, selling ZERO cards is virtually impossible given these reports of actual sales occurring. The market title asks if ZERO cards sold - this is almost certainly false.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -36%\nExpected Value: 36% \u00d7 ~$0.64 = ~$0.23 per dollar risked\nReasoning: Despite increased US sanctions and military posturing, Maduro has survived similar pressure for years. Russia is actively reaffirming support. Authoritarian leaders rarely leave power due to external pressure alone, and there's no indication of internal military coup or mass defection. The market significantly overestimates regime change probability in just 3.5 months.",

Pacers have won 2 straight and are improving. The 6.5 spread is reasonable given current form, making this close to fair value.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -15.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong negative edge favors NO\nReasoning: The market severely overestimates the probability of ZERO sales. Even with underwhelming performance versus targets, the program exists and has generated some revenue ($5B claimed in early reports). Selling literally zero cards for the entire year 2025 is unlikely - even token sales to supporters would break this threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -3.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal edge, not actionable\nReasoning: While U.S. sanctions intensified on Dec 11 and military buildup suggests pressure, Maduro has survived similar crises with Russian/Chinese backing. Putin just reaffirmed support. The 61% market price reasonably reflects elevated but uncertain regime change risk - close to fair value.",
