  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that AC Milan is a likely winner, but trades are split as only some analysts calculate an edge above the 10% threshold. There is unanimous agreement to avoid the Nets/Mavericks over/under market due to a lack of actionable information. For the Pistons spread, analysts are sharply divided, with some seeing value on Detroit -7.5 and others on Atlanta +7.5, indicating high uncertainty.",

They are on an unbeaten streak and playing at home, which increases their chances of winning against Sassuolo, particularly with Sassuolo missing a key player. However, the edge is below the 10% threshold needed for a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 50%  \nMarket Price: 49.0%  \nEdge: +1% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Not enough edge for a trade  \nReasoning: Without specific information on team form, injuries, or betting line movements, it's difficult to gauge the probability accurately. The market price reflects a typical 50/50 scenario for an over/under bet, and without further context, there is no substantial edge.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nYour Probability: 65%  \nMarket Price: 52.0%  \nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +13% (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)  \nReasoning: The Pistons are performing exceptionally well, leading their conference and demonstrating strong team play. Given their recent form and home advantage, a 7.5-point spread seems likely to be covered, providing a noticeable edge over the current market price.",

This is a strong home favorite scenario, but edge falls just below threshold.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 49%\nEdge: +1%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: No specific context available for this matchup's scoring tendencies, pace factors, or injury situations.

The Hawks have talent and chemistry, and 7.5 is a large spread - historically covers at this number are closer to 45-48% for home favorites.",
