This position was reaffirmed by Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang on September 30, 2025, who stated, \"There will be no recognition and normalization with Israel... unless Israel first recognizes an independent and sovereign Palestinian state.\" ([indonesiabusinesspost.com](https://indonesiabusinesspost.com/5351/geopolitics/fm-rules-out-normalization-with-israel-without-palestinian-recognition?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn April 2024, Indonesia's Foreign Ministry dismissed speculation about establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, emphasizing that there were no plans to do so, particularly given Israel's actions in Gaza at that time.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law on November 19, 2025, mandates the release of all unclassified documents related to Jeffrey Epstein by December 19, 2025. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_Files_Transparency_Act?utm_source=openai)) However, prior to this, fact-checking organizations have found no mention of Obama in any publicly available Epstein-related documents.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Markets 1 and 2, based on Indonesia's unwavering diplomatic precondition and the absence of evidence linking Obama to the Epstein files. For Market 3, two AIs predict \"NO\" due to Burnley's poor form and injuries, while one abstains, citing Fulham's own struggles and the match's uncertainty. Overall, the collective analysis finds high confidence for \"NO\" on the first two markets, but acknowledges some risk in the sports prediction.",

This position has been reaffirmed multiple times, most recently in late 2025. Given the current geopolitical stance and past rejections of normalization, it is unlikely that relations will be normalized by the deadline.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: There is no evidence or indication that Barack Obama is named in the newly released Epstein files. Fact-checking organizations have not found any mention of Obama in Epstein-related documents, and the transparency act does not suggest any such inclusion. Thus, the likelihood of Obama being named is low.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Burnley FC has been struggling significantly in recent matches, losing their last five games. Additionally, they are facing several key player absences due to injuries and suspensions, which further weakens their chances against Fulham FC. Despite Fulham's own challenges, Burnley's current form and squad issues make a victory unlikely.",
