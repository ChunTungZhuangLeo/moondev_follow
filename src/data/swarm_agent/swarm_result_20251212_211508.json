Both Democratic and Republican proposals were rejected, leading to concerns about rising health insurance premiums for millions of Americans starting January 1, 2026. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/republican-controlled-us-congress-poised-allow-obamacare-health-subsidies-expire-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe expiration of these subsidies is projected to more than double average annual premiums for ACA Marketplace enrollees, increasing from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026. This significant rise could result in approximately 4 million people dropping their health coverage.

In August 2025, President Trump announced plans to eliminate mail-in ballots and certain voting machines, claiming they are \"corrupt\" and \"a complete and total disaster.\" ([yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-says-sign-executive-order-143848676.html?utm_source=openai)) He stated that an executive order was being prepared to address these issues ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ban-mail-in-voting-before-2026-midterm-elections/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, legal experts and constitutional scholars have raised concerns about the feasibility of such actions. The U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to regulate elections, making it unlikely that the federal government can unilaterally ban mail-in voting or voting machines.

The first volume, released on November 26, garnered 59.6 million views within six days, setting a new record for the largest English-language premiere week on the platform.

This sharp decrease is not uncommon for binge-worthy series, as many viewers tend to watch episodes rapidly after release.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1 as having a negative edge due to uncertainty around the 2026 House election, with most AIs estimating a true probability well below the market's 69%. For Market 2, all models agree the market price is too high given legal constraints, though they disagree on the magnitude of the edge. Market 3 is also seen as overpriced, with analysts citing the show's recent viewership drop as a key reason.",

News confirms credits failed to extend (high probability ~90%), but Democrats winning House in 2026 is uncertain (maybe 40-50% given midterm dynamics). Combined probability should be ~35-45%. However, the 69% price seems inconsistent - either the market title is confusing or I'm misreading it. The large negative edge suggests NO, but I'd want to verify market mechanics first.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump act to ban mail-in voting or voting machines in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 96.9%\nEdge: -88.9%\n\nWait - the recent trade is $1,174.53 on NO, meaning market is at 96.9% NO (3.1% YES). Let me recalculate:\n\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 3.1% (YES)\nEdge: +1.9%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: Trump announced plans but constitutional barriers make federal bans nearly impossible.

No major competing releases mentioned for Dec 16 week. The show should maintain #1 position, though the declining trajectory creates slight uncertainty.

The ACA credits have already failed to pass (first condition likely met), but predicting 2026 House outcomes 18+ months out is highly uncertain with no clear Democratic advantage yet established.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 82%\nMarket Price: 96.9%\nEdge: -14.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +14.9% on NO side\nReasoning: While Trump announced plans in August 2025, constitutional experts confirm states control election administration, making federal bans legally impossible. With only 2 weeks left in 2025, there's insufficient time for any meaningful action. The market severely overestimates the probability of actual implementation.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO** - The market is pricing in Trump's rhetoric rather than legal/practical reality. States have constitutional authority over elections, and no concrete actions have materialized despite announcements 4 months ago.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -80.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +80.8% on NO side\nReasoning: Stranger Things 5 viewership dropped 60% in week 2 (Dec 1-7) to 23.6M views. By December 16, it will be 3+ weeks post-release with typical continued decay. Other Netflix releases will likely dominate as ST5 ages out of the top spot following normal viewership patterns.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO** - This is the strongest edge of the three markets. The market is ignoring the massive 60% viewership drop and the natural decay curve. Three weeks after release, Stranger Things 5 is very unlikely to still be #1, especially with Netflix's constant new content releases.",
