For Market 2, there is strong agreement that the 82% price for Google is overvalued, with four of five AIs recommending a \"NO\" bet due to competitive pressure from OpenAI.

Given Na'Vi's higher ranking (#10 vs #16), better recent form (3-2 vs 2-3 in last 5), and head-to-head victory, Na'Vi should win approximately 70-75% of the time.

However, the market price of 25.2% appears to be for Yakutou Brothers winning (based on the recent $2k bet), making the actual Na'Vi price ~74.8%. This suggests the market already prices Na'Vi correctly at 75%, leaving minimal edge.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - The market appears efficiently priced once we clarify that 25.2% is the Yakutou Brothers price, not Na'Vi.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Will Google have the top AI model on December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 82.0%\nEdge: -27.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +27% on NO side\n\n**Reasoning:** While Gemini 3 Deep Think launched December 2025 with impressive benchmarks, OpenAI's GPT-5.2 (released Dec 11) represents a major competitive response. With 19 days remaining until Dec 31, multiple companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, potentially others) could release superior models. The 82% price overvalues Google's ability to maintain leadership for the full remaining period. History shows AI leadership changes rapidly.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Market significantly overprices Google's probability of maintaining top position through year-end.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Spread: Pistons (-6.5) vs Hawks**\n\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 53.9%\nEdge: +14.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +14.1% \u00d7 ~2.0 payout = ~28% EV\n\n**Reasoning:** Detroit leads the East at 19-5 with a 3-game home winning streak, including dominant wins over quality opponents (beat Bucks by 12 at home). Atlanta is 14-11 and just snapped a 3-game losing streak against weak Washington. The 6.5-point home spread undervalues Detroit's current dominance and home court advantage. Pistons have been covering spreads consistently.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge on Pistons covering -6.5 at home against a mediocre Hawks team.",
