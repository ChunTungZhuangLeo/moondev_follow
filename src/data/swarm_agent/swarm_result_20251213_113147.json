However, several recent developments provide context to assess the likelihood of such an event:\n\n**Cabinet Reshuffles and Ministerial Resignations:**\n- In September 2025, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner resigned due to a tax error involving her property purchase. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-deputy-pm-rayner-quits-over-tax-error-local-media-reports-2025-09-05/?utm_source=openai))\n- Following Rayner's departure, Starmer conducted a significant cabinet reshuffle, appointing David Lammy as Deputy Prime Minister and Yvette Cooper as Foreign Secretary. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/330c39c53c4d6710c19855f45598c400?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Approval Ratings:**\n- In May 2025, a YouGov survey indicated that 69% of voters held an unfavorable view of Starmer, with only 23% viewing him favorably.

However, historical data and current trends provide some context for estimating the turnout.\n\n**Historical Voter Turnout:**\n\n- **2021 Election:** The previous general election in 2021 saw a voter turnout of approximately 68.58%, marking an 11% increase from the 2017 election. ([electionguide.org](https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/3646/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Current Election Context:**\n\n- **Election Delays:** The 2025 election has experienced significant delays in vote counting due to systemic failures and political infighting. As of December 13, 2025, critical delays have left hundreds of thousands of ballots uncounted, and 15% of tally sheets have been flagged for inconsistencies.

The situation is too uncertain to confidently predict his resignation within this timeframe.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite the delays and irregularities in the 2025 Honduran general election, historical voter turnout rates have been relatively high, with the 2021 election seeing 68.58% turnout. It seems likely that the turnout will still exceed 55%, even amidst current challenges.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both Ey\u00fcpspor and \u00c7aykur Rizespor have been performing similarly poorly, and their recent forms are comparable. The match outcome is too unpredictable given their closely matched positions and inconsistent performances, making it difficult to confidently bet on Ey\u00fcpspor winning.",
