Both candidates are in a tight race, and allegations of fraud complicate the prediction. The uncertainty of the recount's outcome makes it prudent to avoid taking a position.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The Panthers are favored against the Saints, who have struggled this season with a 3-10 record. The Panthers have shown strong recent form, particularly after defeating the Rams. The Saints, despite a recent win, have not shown consistent performance, making the Panthers a more likely winner.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The Pistons have a superior record (19-5) compared to the Hawks (14-11) and have already won the previous two encounters this season. Their strong recent performance and solid defensive ranking suggest they are likely to win again against the Hawks.",
