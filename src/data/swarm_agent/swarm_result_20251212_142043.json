This event, termed the \"National March,\" attracted tens of thousands of participants and was described as the largest organized by the Tisza Party to date. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9ter_Magyar?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Policy Proposals:** In August 2025, Magyar introduced the \"Szent Istv\u00e1n-program,\" aiming to address issues such as population decline, emigration, and the establishment of super-hospitals. He also emphasized the importance of local government independence.

Consequently, prediction markets on platforms like Polymarket are currently inactive, with no trading volume or odds available for scenarios such as \"VOOI FDV above $300M one day after launch.\" ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/vooi-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch/vooi-fdv-above-300m-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai))\n\nVOOI's roadmap indicates that the VOOI token is expected to launch by December 31, 2026. The roadmap outlines the following phases:\n\n- **Phase 2 (2025 Q1\u2013Q2):**\n  - Q1: Introduction of Derivative Marketplaces & AI support.\n  - Q2: Launch of VOOI based on the Chain Abstraction approach and VOOI XP Program.\n\n- **Phase 3 (2025 Q3\u2013Q4):**\n  - VOOI V3 \u2013 VOOI Ultra.\n\nThese phases may overlap, allowing for continuous iteration and feature delivery throughout the development cycle.

However, recent developments indicate that Warsh remains a prominent contender for the position.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Final Round of Interviews:** President Trump, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is set to begin the final round of interviews this week to select the next Federal Reserve Chair. Reports suggest that Warsh is among the candidates being considered.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as a clear mispricing, with four AIs recommending a \"NO\" trade due to the token's distant 2026 launch date versus the market's 87% implied probability. For Market 1, opinions are split between \"NO_TRADE\" and one \"YES,\" reflecting disagreement on Magyar's chances against Orb\u00e1n's entrenched power. Regarding Market 3, most analysts agree the 88% price overvalues Warsh's nomination odds, favoring a \"NO\" bet.",

Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party controls significant institutional advantages. The 48% market price reasonably reflects the uncertainty of whether Magyar will win the election and become PM.

The market is currently pricing an 87% chance of an event that cannot happen in the near term since the token hasn't launched yet. This is a clear mispricing unless there's been a recent unannounced launch, which the search context explicitly denies.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 88%\nEdge: -23% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +23% on NO side\nReasoning: While Warsh is a \"prominent contender\" in final interviews, 88% probability is too high given that interviews are just beginning this week and multiple candidates are being considered. The market is overconfident - there's significant uncertainty remaining in the selection process. Historical precedent shows Trump often surprises with his final picks.",

The 2026 election is still uncertain, and while Magyar is the strongest opposition challenger in years, unseating Orb\u00e1n remains an uphill battle.

The market shows recent large NO trades ($888), and there's no confirmed launch date or tokenomics. Achieving $300M FDV for an unproven DeFi project is highly uncertain, and the extreme market price of 87.3% YES seems completely disconnected from the reality that this token doesn't even have a confirmed near-term launch.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Trump nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 82%\nMarket Price: 88.0%\nEdge: -6% (82 - 88)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Warsh is clearly a frontrunner with final interviews happening this week, and he has Bessent's backing.
