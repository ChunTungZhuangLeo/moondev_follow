  "consensus_summary": "The AI models show strong consensus for \"NO TRADE\" on the esports market due to the even head-to-head record, but they are split on the soccer draw and Gaza strike markets. For the soccer match, disagreement centers on whether Pisa's recent away draws or the historical lack of draws between the teams is more predictive. Regarding Gaza, the split reflects a fundamental debate between interpreting the absence of specific strike plans as a \"No\" versus assuming ongoing conflict patterns as a \"Yes.\"",

The lack of consistent historical draws between these teams makes it difficult to confidently predict a draw outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Given the current focus on humanitarian efforts and the involvement of an International Stabilization Force, it seems less likely that Israel will conduct a strike on Gaza on December 12, 2025. The recent trade leaning towards \"No\" supports this assessment, suggesting a lower probability of military action on that date.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The head-to-head record between Dplus KIA and Hanwha Life Esports is very close, and while Hanwha Life Esports recently won their last encounter, both teams have shown strong performances. The evenly matched history and recent performances make it challenging to predict the winner with high confidence.",

Given both teams' struggles near the bottom of the league, a draw is a plausible outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The news explicitly states that \"there is no specific information indicating that Israel plans to strike Gaza on this date,\" directly addressing the market's premise. Additionally, plans for an International Stabilization Force suggest a move towards security and redevelopment rather than immediate strikes.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Hanwha Life Esports won their most recent significant match against Dplus KIA, the overall head-to-head record is closely contested (DK 8 wins, HLE 7 wins) and both teams are performing strongly in the current KeSPA Cup. Without specific information for Game 1, it's difficult to confidently predict a winner.",

Given Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza and the pattern of daily strikes throughout the conflict, it is highly probable that strikes occurred or will occur today, despite no specific pre-announced operations.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The match is scheduled for today with no results available yet. The teams have a closely contested 8-7 historical record, and their most recent playoff meeting went to a full 5 games, indicating competitive balance with no clear edge for either team in Game 1.",
