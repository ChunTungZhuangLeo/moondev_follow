  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with all models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to a forecasted high temperature below the market's range. For Market 1, most analysts agree the \"YES\" price is overvalued, but they disagree on the true probability and whether the edge justifies a trade. Regarding Market 3, all responses converge on \"NO_TRADE,\" as Heroic's slight edge is deemed insufficient to meet the 10% threshold.",

The market is significantly overvaluing the probability of temperatures falling within this range.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 55%  \nMarket Price: 52.0%  \nEdge: +3% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +3% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Heroic's recent victory over Aurora suggests a slight edge, but Aurora has also defeated Heroic in past encounters, indicating a competitive matchup.

Championship matches typically see BTTS in 50-65% of games. Leicester's poor home form and the competitive nature of this fixture suggests BTTS is likely but nowhere near 95.9%. However, I suspect this market may have already resolved or there's data I'm missing given the extreme price.

With a coastal storm bringing snow and cold temperatures, the high is very unlikely to reach 42-43\u00b0F.

These are evenly matched teams with no clear edge. The market price of 52% for Heroic seems fairly priced given recent results favor Heroic slightly but both teams are competitive.",

Recent head-to-head shows moderate scoring.

Additionally, a coastal storm bringing snow is expected, which typically suppresses high temperatures. The market is severely mispriced - the temperature range of 42-43\u00b0F is highly unlikely given weather data.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: +3.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Heroic won their most recent 2-0 matchup in November 2025, suggesting slight edge, but 52% market price is relatively efficient. Only 3% edge is insufficient for a confident trade. Game 1 outcomes in Dota 2 are highly volatile.\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDED TRADE:\n**Market 2 (NYC Temperature) - BET NO** with strong conviction. The forecast clearly indicates 40-41\u00b0F highs with an incoming snow storm, making 42-43\u00b0F extremely unlikely. This represents a 71% edge opportunity.",
