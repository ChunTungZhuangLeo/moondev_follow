The Strafe community has 97% confidence in Heroic winning the series. Game 1 typically favors the stronger team, and the ranking differential strongly supports Heroic.

Braunschweig is playing AWAY at Dresden, has poor recent form (1W-2D-2L), and Dresden has comparable form. Away wins in 2. Bundesliga are difficult. Traditional betting markets would never price Braunschweig at 92%+ to win away. This looks like a clear NO bet - the true probability is likely 30-40%.",

Braunschweig is the AWAY team at Dresden's Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion with poor form (1W-2D-2L). Dresden home with 2W-1D-2L form. In 2. Bundesliga, away wins occur ~30-35% of time, draws ~25-30%.
