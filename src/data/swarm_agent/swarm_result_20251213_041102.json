However, prediction markets have been active in estimating his tweet frequency for December 2025. For instance, a market on Polymarket titled \"Will Elon Musk post 1320-1359 tweets in December 2025?\" is currently trading at a 7.3% probability, indicating a low likelihood of Musk reaching that tweet count for the month.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly indicates Market 1's \"YES\" price at 85.2% is a severe overvaluation, with most AIs estimating a true probability below 15%, though they disagree on whether to trade \"NO\" or avoid it due to data gaps. For Market 2, there is clear agreement that Team Spirit's chances are undervalued, with a recommended \"YES\" trade based on a consistent ~13-16% edge. Regarding Market 3, the AIs uniformly advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to a lack of specific match context, resulting in no actionable edge.",

Thus, the market is likely overestimating the probability of reaching this tweet count.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Positive\nReasoning: Team Spirit's strong performance and high viewership indicate a competitive advantage, and they are already in the semifinals, increasing their chances of winning.

The 85.2% price on this narrow 20-tweet range is absurdly high when the broader market shows expectations of 360+ tweets. This appears to be a massive mispricing or I'm misreading the market structure.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. If market shows 85.2% on YES for 280-299 range but broader data suggests 360-379 is most likely at only 12.1%, something is off. The 85.2% seems impossibly high for such a narrow range.

With only 4 teams remaining, baseline probability is 25%. Their dominant performance, highest viewership, and pre-tournament favorite status suggest they're better than 29%. Being in semis with momentum justifies ~40%+ probability.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match TS7 vs VIT)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: This is a CS2 esports match (best-of-3 format), not soccer. Over 2.5 means the match goes to 3 games (2-1 result). CS2 matches historically go to 3 games roughly 50-55% of the time between evenly matched teams. The 50% price is fair - no significant edge exists.",

The 280-299 range is just one narrow bucket among many possibilities. With 3+ days remaining in the tracking period and multiple competing ranges, 85.2% for this specific 20-tweet bucket is dramatically overpriced. However, I cannot recommend NO due to insufficient current tweet count data to precisely estimate this bucket's true probability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - While the market appears severely mispriced, I lack real-time tweet count data (currently Dec 13, need counts through Dec 16) to confidently estimate which specific bucket will hit. This is a data-dependent market requiring live tracking.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+16% edge \u00d7 2.45x payout = +39% EV)\nReasoning: Team Spirit just defeated Falcons 2-0 in quarterfinals, reaching semifinals with strong momentum. They led tournament viewership (560k average), showing home crowd/fan advantage. Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15.4% implied) are now outdated - they've proven tournament form. With only 3-4 teams remaining, their true win probability is substantially higher than 29%.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge with Team Spirit having demonstrated in-tournament strength and being undervalued relative to their semifinal position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +12.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Positive (+12% edge \u00d7 2.0x payout = +24% EV)\nReasoning: This appears to be Team Spirit vs Vitality in CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) semifinals at Budapest Major. Both teams have aggressive, high-skill playstyles that historically produce longer series. Semifinal matches at Majors typically feature close competition between evenly-matched teams, increasing likelihood of 3+ maps. The context shows over 2.5 trends heavily toward \"over\" in competitive gaming series.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Market is pricing this as a coin flip, but semifinal matchups between top teams historically favor longer series (3+ maps).",
