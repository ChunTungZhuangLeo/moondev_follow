  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 3 is severely mispriced, with most models recommending a \"NO\" bet against Osasuna winning due to Barcelona's dominance. For Market 2, opinions are split between \"YES\" and \"NO,\" indicating high uncertainty and a lack of clear edge. Market 1 is consistently seen as efficiently priced, with no model finding a sufficient edge to recommend a trade.",

While the Jaguars are hot with 4 straight wins and Lawrence playing well, NFL spreads over 13 points rarely cover consistently. The market seems fairly priced - the Jets can lose by 10-13 and still cover. Not enough edge either direction.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Graham Platner be the Democratic nominee for Senate in Maine?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 60%\nEdge: -25%\nExpected Value: 25% \u00d7 ~1.67 = +41.75% ROI\nReasoning: Despite progressive endorsements from Bernie Sanders and PCCC, Platner is running against sitting Governor Janet Mills who has the establishment backing, name recognition, and fundraising advantages that typically win primaries. Governors running for Senate in their own state have historically strong advantages. The market appears to be overweighting progressive enthusiasm while underweighting Mills' structural advantages in a state that's moderate-leaning Democratic.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will CA Osasuna win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 93%\nEdge: -85%\nExpected Value: This market appears MISPRICED - likely asking if Barcelona wins\nReasoning: The market title asks if Osasuna will WIN, but the 93% price suggests it's pricing Barcelona winning. Osasuna is playing AWAY at Camp Nou against league-leading Barcelona on a 6-game winning streak. Osasuna's true win probability is around 8-12%, not 93%. If this market is correctly titled (Osasuna to win = 93%), this is a strong NO. If it's actually Barcelona to win, then 93% is reasonable for the league leader at home.",

Market is efficiently priced - only 3% edge isn't worth the risk given spread volatility.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 60.0%\nEdge: +5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate (~0.05 \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Platner has strong progressive endorsements (Bernie Sanders, UAW, PCCC) which typically drive Democratic primary success, but Governor Mills has incumbent advantage and name recognition.

Osasuna has minimal chance (~8%) of winning at Camp Nou against this dominant Barcelona side. The 93% implies Osasuna is overwhelming favorite, which contradicts all evidence. **STRONG NO BET - the market has likely confused which team will win.**\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 3 - BET NO with maximum conviction**\n\nThe 85% edge on Market 3 represents exceptional value.
