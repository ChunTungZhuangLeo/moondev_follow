  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no trades with a clear 10%+ edge, as most AIs find Market 1's Thunder spread too close to call and Market 3's Musk tweet probability severely mispriced against the \"No\" side. There is notable disagreement on Market 2, with some seeing value in \"No\" (not a draw) while others calculate an edge below the threshold or find it fairly priced. Overall, the analyses converge on a recommendation of no actionable trades based on the provided criteria.",

However, 9.5 is a large spread and Spurs have been competitive. Edge exists but below 10% threshold for trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 83%\nEdge: +9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Marginal (~$5.29 per $100 risked)\nReasoning: Market is asking if match will END IN A DRAW (83% = NO draw). Atl\u00e9tico Madrid has won 7/8 home games, Valencia winless in 7 away matches. Historical data shows only 1 draw in last 10 meetings. A draw is extremely unlikely (~8% true probability), meaning NO should be ~92%. However, edge is just below 10% threshold.\n\n**WAIT - RECONSIDERING:**\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 8% (probability of draw)\nMarket Price: 83% (NO - not a draw)\nEdge: -9% (market slightly overpricing NO)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The 83% market price is for NO (not a draw).

The 85.2% price appears to be a specific isolated market that's severely mispriced compared to the broader consensus showing this range is unlikely. Strong NO recommendation.",

      "response": "**MARKET 1: Thunder (-9.5)**\n\nMARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50%\nEdge: +2%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: The Thunder are on a historic 16-game winning streak and dominated the Suns by 49 points. However, NBA Cup semifinal games tend to be more competitive, and the Spurs have been playing well with Castle's emergence. The 9.5 spread is appropriately priced for a neutral-site semifinal game. Edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Atl\u00e9tico Madrid vs. Valencia CF end in a draw?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 18%\nMarket Price: 83% (for NO draw, meaning 17% for draw)\nEdge: The market says 83% NO draw, my estimate is 82% NO draw\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Wait - let me re-read this. The market is pricing 83% that it will NOT be a draw. Atl\u00e9tico is dominant at home (7/8 wins), Valencia hasn't won away all season. Historical draw rate in such mismatches is typically 15-20%. The market seems correctly priced. No edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 82% (no draw)\nMarket Price: 83%\nEdge: -1%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Atl\u00e9tico's home dominance and Valencia's away struggles make a draw unlikely (~18%).

The market price of 85.2% for YES is completely inconsistent with the actual Polymarket data showing 5%. This appears to be a massive mispricing or data error. Strong NO.\n\n**Wait - this seems like a market display error. Let me reconsider: if the market shows 85.2% YES for 280-299 tweets, but another source shows 5%, there's likely confusion. Given we're 4+ days into the 7-day period, if Musk is on pace for 360+ tweets, 280-299 is very unlikely.**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 10%\nMarket Price: 85.2%\nEdge: -75.2%\nExpected Value: Very high betting NO\nReasoning: Market data suggests 360-379 tweets is most likely outcome. With 4 days elapsed, his tweeting pace would need to dramatically slow for 280-299 to hit. The 85.2% YES price appears severely mispriced.",
