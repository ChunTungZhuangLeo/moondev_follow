The recent trade favoring Melbourne could be overly optimistic given their form.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Fulham FC must win by at least two goals to cover the -1.5 spread, but their recent narrow losses and victories suggest they are not currently in dominant form. The significant betting on Burnley indicates skepticism about Fulham's ability to cover this spread.",
