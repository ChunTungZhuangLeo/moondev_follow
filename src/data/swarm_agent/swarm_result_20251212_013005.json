Consequently, it's challenging to determine the frequency with which he used the word \"job\" during his speech.\n\nHistorically, President Trump has frequently emphasized themes related to employment and the economy in his speeches. For instance, during his 2018 State of the Union Address, he highlighted the creation of 200,000 manufacturing jobs and a 45-year low in unemployment rates. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_State_of_the_Union_Address?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, in a 2016 campaign speech, he stated, \"I will fight for every last American job.\" ([time.com](https://time.com/4495507/donald-trump-economy-speech-transcript/?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven this pattern, it's plausible that President Trump incorporated the term \"job\" multiple times in his recent remarks at the Congressional...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will China invade Taiwan by end of 2026?\nRecent trade: $6,960.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-china-invade-taiwan-before-2027\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the likelihood of China invading Taiwan by the end of 2026 remains uncertain, with various factors influencing this potential outcome.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Military Activities:** On December 11, 2025, the United States and Japan conducted joint military flight drills near Japan's western airspace, involving U.S. B-52 bombers and Japanese F-35 and F-15 jets. This exercise was a response to increased Chinese and Russian military activities in the region, including a joint bomber flight near Japan and incidents where Chinese military aircraft allegedly locked radar on Japanese jets. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/87e9785311d7254fc8e14188bd05f54c?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Diplomatic Tensions:** China has consistently opposed official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. On December 3, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged the U.S. to cease such exchanges and avoid sending signals to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Xi Jinping out before 2027?\nRecent trade: $7,120.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/xi-jinping-out-before-2027\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no official confirmation regarding Chinese President Xi Jinping's resignation before 2027. However, several developments have fueled speculation about a potential leadership change:\n\n**Rumors and Speculation:**\n\n- **August 2025:** Media figure Jiang Wangzheng suggested that Xi Jinping would not serve a fourth term, outlining a phased power transition plan. This plan included Xi gradually transferring authority to Li Qiang, stepping back from public appearances before the Fourth Plenary Session, relinquishing some positions at the Fifth Plenary Session, and retiring entirely around the Sixth Plenary Session. ([peoplenewstoday.com](https://www.peoplenewstoday.com/news/en/2025/08/13/1113242.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **June 2025:** Analysts noted Xi's increased delegation of authority among Communist Party members, leading to speculation that he might be preparing for an orderly power handover. His absence from public events, such as the BRICS 2025 Summi...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Due to the lack of a publicly available transcript or detailed account of President Trump's remarks at the Congressional Ball on December 11, 2025, it is difficult to ascertain whether he said \"job\" 5 or more times. Historically, Trump has emphasized job-related themes, but the absence of concrete evidence makes this market too uncertain for a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Recent military activities and diplomatic tensions highlight an ongoing volatile situation between China and Taiwan, yet there is no definitive indication of an imminent invasion. The recent joint military drills by the U.S. and Japan suggest a strong international deterrence presence, supporting the likelihood that China will not invade Taiwan by the end of 2026.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Although there are rumors and speculation about a potential leadership change, there is no official confirmation or concrete steps indicating that Xi Jinping will be out before 2027. The structured nature of Chinese political transitions and the lack of substantial evidence of an imminent change make it more likely that Xi will remain in power until at least 2027.",

Without concrete information on what was actually said, this is essentially gambling on unknown results that may never be properly resolved.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite elevated tensions and military posturing, a full-scale invasion of Taiwan within the next 12 months remains highly unlikely given the enormous economic, military, and diplomatic costs China would face. The recent joint US-Japan drills demonstrate continued Western commitment to regional deterrence.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While there are rumors about potential power transitions, Xi Jinping has consolidated unprecedented control over the CCP and there are no credible indicators of an imminent departure. Speculation from media figures about phased transitions is far from confirmation, and Xi stepping down before 2027 would represent a dramatic and unexpected reversal of his power consolidation.",

The large recent trade ($6,960 on No) and joint US-Japan military exercises suggest continued deterrence, while a full-scale invasion by end of 2026 would require extensive visible military buildup not currently evident.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite speculation about potential power transitions and Xi's delegation of authority, there are no concrete indicators of imminent resignation. The rumors remain unconfirmed, and Xi has consolidated significant power with no constitutional term limits, making departure before 2027 highly unlikely.",
