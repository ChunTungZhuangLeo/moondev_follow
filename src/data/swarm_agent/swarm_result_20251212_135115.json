These actions were less frequent and intense compared to previous months, possibly due to diplomatic considerations, including Pope Leo XIV's visit to Lebanon.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear trade for Market 1, as most AIs see insufficient edge around the 233.5 point total. For Market 2, there is sharp disagreement, with some AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade on BIG citing a 10%+ edge, while others call it a coin flip. Regarding Market 3, analysts broadly agree the \"YES\" price is overvalued, but they disagree on whether the \"NO\" side offers a sufficient positive edge to meet the 10% threshold for a recommended trade.",

The Pistons appear to play strong defense, and both recent games came in well under this total. However, the edge is only 4% which doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Counter-Strike: BIG vs Sangal (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 48%\nEdge: +14%\nExpected Value: 14% \u00d7 2.08 = +29.1% ROI\nReasoning: BIG is ranked higher globally (53rd vs 59th) and has comparable recent form. In BO3 formats, the higher-ranked team with more experience typically has an advantage. BIG's roster has more proven talent, and the market at 48% essentially prices this as a coin flip, which undervalues BIG's edge in this matchup.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Israel strike Lebanon on December 13?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 79.3%\nEdge: -4.3%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: While there's a ceasefire in place and operations have been \"less frequent and intense,\" Israel has consistently conducted operations in Lebanon throughout December 2025.
