This bet focuses on the duration of a fight, allowing bettors to predict whether the bout will last more than 1.5 rounds (approximately 7 minutes and 30 seconds) or less.\n\n**Understanding the Bet:**\n\n- **Over 1.5 Rounds:** The fight must last beyond 7 minutes and 30 seconds. For a three-round fight, this means reaching the second half of the second round.\n\n- **Under 1.5 Rounds:** The fight concludes before the 7-minute and 30-second mark.\n\n**Recent Trends and Considerations:**\n\n- **Fighter Durability:** Bouts involving fighters known for their endurance and defensive skills are more likely to go the distance, making the \"Over\" bet more appealing.\n\n- **Fighting Styles:** Aggressive fighters with knockout power may lead to quicker finishes, favoring the \"Under\" bet.\n\n- **Matchmaking and Fight Dynamics:** The specific matchup, including figh...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

Without specific information on pending airdrops but given the high probability reflected in the market, betting \"No\" aligns with current market sentiment.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: NEC Nijmegen is in strong form with 4 wins in their last 5 matches, while Telstar is struggling. The Over/Under line is set at a low 1.5 goals, which suggests that even a single goal by NEC could be quickly followed by another given their recent performance, making the \"Over\" bet more promising.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Without specific information on the fighters involved, their styles, or durability, it is difficult to ascertain whether the fight will conclude before or after the 1.5 rounds mark.
