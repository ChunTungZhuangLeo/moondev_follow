The market's current price closely aligns with my probability estimate, so there isn't enough edge to justify a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nYour Probability: 60%  \nMarket Price: 41.0%  \nEdge: +19% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +0.19 \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite Chelsea's recent mixed form, they are favored with betting odds suggesting a higher probability of winning against Everton. Considering their superior head-to-head record and the home advantage at Stamford Bridge, the probability of a Chelsea win is higher than the market's current price suggests, providing a significant edge.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 60%  \nMarket Price: 55.0%  \nEdge: +5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +0.05 \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Polls and expert predictions suggest a narrow victory for Orb\u00e1n, but with a significant portion of the electorate favoring his main challenger, the outcome remains uncertain.

With only ~19 days left in 2025 and no urgency, the 87% price accurately reflects the high likelihood of no announcement this year.

Despite recent mixed form, Chelsea's home advantage at Stamford Bridge and superior head-to-head record against Everton suggest the market at 41% significantly underprices their chances.

Fidesz has massive resource advantages, experienced candidates, and controls much of the media landscape. Analyst predictions favor a narrow Orb\u00e1n victory. The 55% market price underestimates incumbent advantage and structural factors favoring Fidesz in Hungarian elections.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Market 1: NO_TRADE (insufficient edge)\n- Market 2: **YES** (14% edge)\n- Market 3: **YES** (13% edge)",

While there's some chance he delays, the market price of 87% already reflects high probability he won't announce in 2025. The remaining weeks of 2025 are limited, making announcement unlikely but not impossible enough to justify a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Your Probability:** 55%\n**Market Price:** 41%\n**Edge:** +14% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +14% \u00d7 2.44 payout = +34% EV\n**Reasoning:** Chelsea is heavily favored by bookmakers (1.67 odds = ~60% implied probability) playing at home at Stamford Bridge. While Chelsea has mixed recent form and Everton is playing well, the market at 41% significantly undervalues Chelsea's home advantage and superior squad quality. Bookmaker consensus suggests 55-60% win probability is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 58%\n**Market Price:** 55%\n**Edge:** +3% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Minimal\n**Reasoning:** Polls show 50% believe Orb\u00e1n will win 2026 elections, with analyst predictions favoring a narrow Orb\u00e1n victory due to Fidesz's resource advantages. However, challenger P\u00e9ter Magyar has gained significant momentum. The market price of 55% fairly reflects the uncertainty of an election 16+ months away with a credible opposition challenger.
