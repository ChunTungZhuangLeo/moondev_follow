Despite initial claims of strong demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" program was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to attract affluent individuals and generate substantial revenue for the U.S. Treasury.

Pacers have won two straight and are improving. A 6.5-point spread is substantial given the 76ers' inconsistency. The market price is roughly fair - no significant edge either direction.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -82%\nExpected Value: Very High (82% edge \u00d7 ~7.7x payout on NO)\nReasoning: The search results explicitly state that Commerce Secretary Lutnick reported selling 1,000 Gold Cards in a single day in March 2025. This means Trump has already sold Gold Cards in 2025, making \"0 Gold Cards sold\" essentially impossible. The market at 87% YES is massively mispriced - this should resolve NO.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -36%\nExpected Value: High (36% edge \u00d7 ~1.6x payout on NO)\nReasoning: Despite U.S. pressure and military posturing, authoritarian leaders rarely fall to external pressure alone. Putin's explicit support for Maduro strengthens his position. Maduro has survived multiple crises since 2013, including the 2019 Guaid\u00f3 challenge. With only ~3.5 months remaining and no imminent internal collapse visible, 61% probability of removal is significantly overpriced. Historical base rates for dictator removal in this timeframe are much lower.",

Pacers won 2 straight and have momentum. The 6.5 spread is fair given recent form. Edge is insufficient for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 95%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: +8.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate (~$0.80 per $10 bet)\nReasoning: The market title asks if Trump will sell \"0 Gold Cards\" (meaning ZERO cards). Context shows 1,000 cards were already sold in March 2025, so the answer is definitively NO - he will NOT sell zero cards. However, the 87% price suggests the market is betting YES (that he WILL sell zero), which appears to be a misunderstanding of the question. Edge is close but below 10% threshold.\n\n**WAIT - Re-reading the question: \"Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?\" If 87% is betting YES, that means 87% think he WILL sell ZERO cards. But he already sold 1,000 in March 2025. This market should be at 0-5% YES maximum.**\n\nRevised Analysis:\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -85.0% (Market is severely mispriced)\nExpected Value: Extremely High (~$8.50+ per $10 bet on NO)\nReasoning: Trump already sold 1,000 Gold Cards in March 2025 according to Commerce Secretary Lutnick. The question asks if he will sell ZERO cards in 2025 - this is factually impossible since sales already occurred. Bet NO with extreme confidence.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: +11.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong (~$1.10 per $10 bet)\nReasoning: Trump military build-up in Caribbean signals imminent action, while Maduro needs Russian support to survive. U.S. regime change pressure is intensifying significantly. 4-month window (Dec 2025-March 2026) provides sufficient time for forced transition. Market underpricing the escalation.",
