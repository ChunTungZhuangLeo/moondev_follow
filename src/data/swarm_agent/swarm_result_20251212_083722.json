  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for betting \"NO\" on the Trump tariff dividend market due to the 2026 implementation timeline, while opinions on the NBA games are mixed with no clear 10%+ edge agreement. Analysts generally agree the Thunder are favorites but disagree on whether their market price offers value, and most see some edge on the Cavaliers spread though estimates vary. Overall, only the Trump market shows consistent, high-confidence disagreement with the current price across multiple analyses.",

Despite the Spurs' advancement, the Thunder's current form and recent performances make them strong favorites to win, but the market price already reflects this probability quite accurately.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -12.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$0.125 (negative edge)\nReasoning: While President Trump has announced plans for the tariff dividend, legal and fiscal hurdles remain significant.

However, NBA Cup semifinal games can be more competitive, and the Spurs have momentum after beating the Lakers. The market is priced correctly - Thunder should win but 81% is fair given playoff-style intensity.\n\nNO_TRADE\n\n---\n\nMARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -82.5%\nExpected Value: Very High (betting NO)\nReasoning: The news clearly states payments won't begin until \"mid-2026,\" not 2025. The market asks specifically about 2025. Even if Trump announces or \"creates\" the program in 2025, the actual implementation faces legal challenges at the Supreme Court and Treasury is considering tax cuts instead of direct payments. The market resolution likely requires actual creation/implementation, which appears scheduled for 2026.\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: Spread: Cavaliers (-14.5)\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: +6%\nExpected Value: Moderate but below threshold\nReasoning: Cavaliers are heavy favorites against the league's worst team. Wizards have lost 13 straight to Cleveland, have the worst defense and point differential in the NBA. Despite Cavs' recent 5-7 stretch, they demolished the Spurs recently with a 31-7 third quarter run. A 14.5-point spread is large but the Wizards are historically bad and Cleveland tends to dominate this matchup.\n\nNO_TRADE",

Spurs showed strength beating Lakers, and single-elimination tournaments create upset variance. Edge insufficient for trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -92.5% (betting NO side gives +92.5% edge)\nExpected Value: Extremely High (92.5% \u00d7 ~38x payout)\nReasoning: Market asks if dividend created \"in 2025\" but Trump's announcement clearly states payments begin \"mid-2026.\" Treasury considering tax cuts instead of direct payments adds implementation uncertainty. This is a NO bet with massive edge.\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: BET NO** - The market has severely mispriced the timeline. The question asks about 2025 creation, but all evidence points to 2026 implementation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: -4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Slightly negative\nReasoning: Cavaliers struggling (5 losses in 7 games) makes 14.5-point spread challenging despite Wizards' terrible defense. 52% market price is approximately fair given recent Cleveland inconsistency and Washington's home court. Insufficient edge.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** Only Market 2 (Trump Tariff Dividend) presents actionable edge. The 97.5% YES price appears to misread the timeline - Trump explicitly stated mid-2026 for payments, making this almost certainly resolving NO for a 2025 creation question. This represents exceptional value on the NO side.",
