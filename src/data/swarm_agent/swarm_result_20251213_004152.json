([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commanders-tell-putin-that-russia-has-captured-siversk-eastern-ukraine-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian military has firmly denied these claims. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Armed Forces stated that Siversk remains under their control, despite ongoing Russian attempts to infiltrate the area. They reported that Russian forces are trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavorable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks are currently on a three-game losing streak and have a poor record on the road (1-8), while North Carolina A&T Aggies have a strong home performance (2-0). The Aggies' key player, Lewis Walker, adds to their advantage, making a win for the Hawks unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: T1 has shown consistent dominance in the LCK 2025 Season, having recently secured a spot at the World Championship after defeating Dplus KIA 3-1 in the playoffs. Their strategic advantage and strong head-to-head record against Dplus KIA make them likely winners in this best-of-five series.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: There is conflicting information regarding the control of Siversk. While Russian commanders claim to have captured it, the Ukrainian military denies these claims, maintaining that they still control the town. The situation remains fluid and uncertain, making it risky to take a definitive position.",

The home advantage and superior record strongly favor the Aggies.\n\n**MARKET 2: T1**\nReasoning: T1 has demonstrated dominance over Dplus KIA, including a recent 3-1 playoff victory, and historically holds a strong head-to-head advantage. T1's consistency and experience in high-stakes matches make them the clear favorite in this BO5.\n\n**MARKET 3: YES**\nReasoning: Russian commanders have already reported to Putin that Siversk was captured on December 11, and while Ukraine disputes this claim, the market likely resolves based on credible reports of capture. With 9 days remaining until December 22 and Russia claiming control, the probability of resolution criteria being met appears high.",

With only 9 days until the December 22 deadline and active Ukrainian defense destroying Russian infiltration attempts, capture seems unlikely in this timeframe.",
