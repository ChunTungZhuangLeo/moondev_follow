However, prediction markets are actively engaging in this speculation. On Polymarket, a platform for such predictions, the market \"Elon Musk # tweets December 9 - December 16, 2025?\" has accumulated over $3 million in volume, with the 280-299 tweet range currently priced at 5% probability. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nHistorically, Musk's tweet frequency has varied, making precise predictions challenging. For instance, between November 25 and December 2, 2025, he posted 253 tweets, leading to a prediction market with over $14 million in volume, where the 260-279 tweet range had a 59% chance, and 240-259 had a 36% chance.

Team Spirit has demonstrated strong performance throughout the tournament, securing a spot in the semifinals after a decisive 2-0 victory over Team Falcons on December 11.

This market allows bettors to predict whether the total number of goals scored in a game will be over or under 2.5. A bet on \"Over 2.5\" wins if the match ends with three or more goals, while a bet on \"Under 2.5\" wins if there are two or fewer goals scored.

For instance, on December 6, 2025, Liverpool FC and Leeds United ended their game in a 3-3 draw, resulting in six goals and an \"Over 2.5\" outcome. Conversely, Chelsea FC and AFC Bournemouth played to a 0-0 draw, leading to an \"Under 2.5\" result.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a severe data discrepancy in Market 1, with most AIs recommending NO_TRADE due to a conflicting 5% probability cited in the context versus the listed 85.2% price. For Market 2, all models agree on a YES trade with a significant positive edge, estimating Team Spirit's true probability between 42-45% against a 29% market price. Regarding Market 3, the unanimous view is NO_TRADE due to a lack of specific match data, resulting in a neutral 50% probability estimate with zero edge.",

This appears to be a data error or the market price shown is incorrect. Based on Musk's historical posting of ~253 tweets in a similar week, and the actual Polymarket odds showing 5% for this range, the true probability is very low.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +13% (42% - 29%)\nExpected Value: 13% \u00d7 3.45 = +44.9% ROI\nReasoning: Team Spirit has reached the semifinals with a dominant 2-0 win, leads viewership engagement, and pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (18%) have improved significantly given their performance. With only 4 teams remaining (semifinal stage), each team should have roughly 25% baseline odds, and Spirit's strong form suggests above-average chances closer to 40%+.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2% (52% - 50%)\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (Team Spirit vs Vitality based on the URL), not soccer.

Without specific head-to-head data for this matchup, the 50/50 pricing seems reasonable and there's insufficient edge to justify a trade.",

The 85.2% price appears to be an error or different question interpretation. Based on Musk's historical pattern of 253 tweets in the prior week and typical variance, 280-299 range has <10% probability.

They defeated Falcons 2-0, lead in viewership engagement, and had 5.50 pre-tournament odds (15-18% implied).

The generic web context about O/U 2.5 goals in soccer is irrelevant to CS2 map count. No edge identified.",
