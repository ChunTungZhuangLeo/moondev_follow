      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both OG and Team Spirit have shown strong recent performances, with Team Spirit having a slightly better historical head-to-head record against OG. However, the recent $1,000 trade on Team Spirit indicates a potential bias in the market. With both teams demonstrating strong capabilities, the outcome is uncertain, making it difficult to confidently bet on either team.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Swansea City's recent improvement with two consecutive clean-sheet victories, they remain in 18th place and are still struggling overall. Stoke City, while also having a poor run, has had a significant win recently and is positioned higher in the standings. The recent trade of $711.14 on \"No\" suggests market sentiment leans against Swansea's victory.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's strong form, securing 13 points in their last five matches, and Wolfsburg's recent 3-1 victory suggest a high-scoring potential for the game. The recent trade of $814.26 on \"Over\" 1.5 goals aligns with the expectation of a high-scoring match, making a \"Yes\" bet on over 1.5 goals reasonable.",
