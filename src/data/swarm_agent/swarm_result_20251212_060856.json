  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly favors the \"Over\" for both NBA point total markets, with most AIs estimating a true probability near 65% against market prices of 53-55%, yielding a recommended trade edge exceeding 10%. For the CS2 match, opinions are split on both the true probability and trade viability, indicating high uncertainty and no clear actionable edge. Overall, the NBA over markets present the most unified and actionable opportunity based on the synthesized analysis.",

Both teams have hit the over in 50% of games this season, and the Pacers are known for their fast-paced offense. The market at 53% significantly undervalues this over, especially given the consensus expert predictions all pointing higher.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: FURIA vs NAVI Map 1 Winner\n\n**Your Probability:** 45%\n**Market Price:** 66%\n**Edge:** -21% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** -21% \u00d7 ~1.52 payout = -32% EV\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** While FURIA recently dominated NAVI 13-2 on Nuke and won their championship series, the market is overreacting to recent results. Map 1 outcomes are highly volatile in CS2, and NAVI remains a world-class team. The 66% price for FURIA is inflated by recency bias - a 45% true probability suggests betting NO (on NAVI) offers significant value with 21% edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Pacers vs. 76ers O/U 227.5\n\n**Your Probability:** 70%\n**Market Price:** 55%\n**Edge:** +15% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +15% \u00d7 ~1.82 payout = +27.3% EV\n**Decision:** YES\n\n**Reasoning:** This is essentially the same game as Market 1, but with a slightly lower total (227.5 vs 228.5). Expert projections of 229.5-231 points make this an even stronger over bet. With both teams' games hitting the over 50% of the time and expert consensus pointing to 230+ points, the market at 55% is mispriced. The 70% true probability offers excellent value on the over.",
