Russian troops attempted to advance from the south to the northern part of the city using armored vehicles, cars, and motorcycles. Despite these efforts, Ukrainian units managed to repel the assault, aided by adverse weather conditions and drone strikes.

However, Ukraine's military firmly denied this claim, asserting that Siversk remains under Ukrainian cont...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Trump out as President before 2027?\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/trump-out-as-president-before-2027\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no definitive evidence indicating that President Donald Trump will resign before 2027. Recent political developments, including impeachment attempts and legal challenges, have not led to his removal from office.\n\n**Impeachment Attempts:**\n\n- On December 11, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 237-140 to dismiss an impeachment resolution against President Trump, introduced by Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas. This marked Green's second unsuccessful attempt this year to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump during his second term. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b502204187ee4b0d7bfb340302a88eae?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Additionally, three Trump Cabinet members\u2014Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2014are facing impeachment threats from select Democratic lawmakers. However, these efforts are unlikely to succeed, as Cabinet impeachments are exceedingly rar...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: TikTok sale announced by March 31?\nRecent trade: $575.65 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/tiktok-sale-announced-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there have been significant developments regarding the potential sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, with a new version of the app expected to launch by March 2026.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **New U.S. Version of TikTok:** ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company, is developing a new app specifically for U.S. users, referred to as \"M2.\" This app is slated for release on September 5, 2025, and will be available in U.S. app stores. Users will need to download this new version to continue accessing the platform, as the current app is expected to cease functioning in the U.S. by March 2026. ([appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/06/tiktok-builds-new-us-app-version-ahead-of-planned-sale?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Sale Negotiations:** President Donald Trump has indicated that a deal for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations is nearly finalized.

The key disagreement centers on whether Trump's statement of a \"nearly finalized\" TikTok deal is sufficient to predict an official announcement by the deadline.",

With these developments and no indication of Russian control, it is unlikely that Russia will capture all of Pokrovsk by December 31.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Recent developments show that impeachment attempts against President Trump have been unsuccessful, and there is no definitive evidence or momentum suggesting that he will be out of office before 2027. Therefore, it is unlikely that Trump will leave the presidency before 2027.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While there are ongoing negotiations for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, the recent focus has been on the development of a new app version for U.S. users. Without clear indications of an imminent sale announcement by March 31, the situation remains uncertain, making it prudent to take no position at this time.",

With only ~19 days remaining until December 31 and Ukrainian forces successfully defending against mechanized assaults, capturing the entire city in this timeframe is highly unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Recent impeachment attempts have failed decisively (237-140 vote to dismiss), and there's no credible pathway to removal. Trump maintains Republican support, and no resignation indicators exist.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The news indicates Trump has said a deal is \"nearly finalized\" and \"pretty much\" worked out involving American investors. While ByteDance is developing a new US app, the ongoing sale negotiations suggest an announcement by March 31 is plausible given the regulatory pressure and active deal-making.",

With no credible path to removal and Trump's second term proceeding normally, he will almost certainly remain president through 2026.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: ByteDance is actively developing a new U.S. version of TikTok (\"M2\") with Trump stating a sale deal is \"nearly finalized\" involving American investors. The company's concrete technical preparations and Trump's public statements about an imminent deal make an announcement by March 31st probable.",
