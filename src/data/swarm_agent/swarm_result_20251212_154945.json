The 76ers are favored by 6.5 points in this matchup. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** In their most recent game on December 7, 2025, the 76ers narrowly lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, 112-108. Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. Joel Embiid struggled offensively, shooting 4-of-21 from the field.

Despite initial claims of high demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" program was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to attract affluent individuals and generate substantial revenue for the U.S. Treasury.

Prediction markets reflect this trend, with platforms like Polymarket indicating a 67% probability that no Gold Cards will be sold in 2025. This suggests a prevailing senti\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?\nCurrent Market Price: 61.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,305.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/maduro-out-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no official confirmation that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro will resign by March 31, 2026. However, recent developments suggest increasing international pressure and internal challenges that could influence his tenure.\n\n**International Sanctions and Actions:**\n\n- **U.S. Sanctions:** On December 11, 2025, the United States imposed sanctions targeting three nephews of First Lady Cilia Flores and six oil tankers linked to Maduro's administration. The U.S. Treasury accused these entities of facilitating deceptive practices and supporting a \"corrupt narco-terrorist regime.\" This move is part of a broader strategy to deter shipowners and insurance companies from engaging with Venezuela's oil exports.

Authoritarian leaders with military backing rarely leave voluntarily in 3.5 months. Sanctions on nephews and oil tankers are incremental pressure, not regime-ending actions.
