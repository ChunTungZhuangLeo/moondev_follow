      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: There have been no earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or higher recorded recently, and such events are extremely rare. The current odds reflect a low probability, and with only about a year left until 2027, it seems unlikely for such a high-magnitude earthquake to occur based on historical frequency.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa SK's recent form is poor, especially at home, with no wins in their last three home matches. However, Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi has also been inconsistent away. Given the close and unpredictable nature of both teams' current forms, taking a position in this market seems risky.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both Eintracht Braunschweig and Dynamo Dresden are struggling in the league, and their recent forms are mixed. While Braunschweig has had a slightly better performance recently, the unpredictability of both teams makes it difficult to have confidence in a particular outcome.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: With only ~3 weeks remaining until 2027 and no 9.0+ earthquakes occurring (recent events maxing at 6.9), the 10% odds seem appropriate or even slightly high given the extreme rarity of such events (only 5 in the past century). Historical base rate supports NO.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa's poor recent form (1 win in 5 matches, winless in last 3 home games) against Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi who have shown some away capability makes this a coin-flip match with insufficient edge to trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Braunschweig is playing away at Dresden, and despite Dresden's poor league position, away wins in lower German leagues are difficult to predict. Braunschweig's mixed form (recent win but also draws) doesn't provide enough conviction for a position.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Magnitude 9.0+ earthquakes are extremely rare (only 5 recorded since 1900), averaging one every 10-20 years. With just over one year remaining until 2027 and no current indicators of imminent mega-thrust events, the 10% odds overestimate the probability of such an exceptional occurrence.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams show poor recent form with Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa winless in their last three home games and inconsistent performances overall. The match appears too unpredictable given both teams' struggles, and the recent $999.50 bet on Yes suggests the odds may already be skewed.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: This is an away match for Braunschweig at Dresden's home stadium. Despite Braunschweig's slightly better league position (14th vs 17th) and recent 2-0 win, Dresden has home advantage and both teams are struggling. The recent $799.89 bet on Yes likely overvalues Braunschweig's chances in this away fixture.",
