  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no tradable edge in Market 1, agreeing the market correctly prices a near-zero probability for a military engagement. For Market 2, most analysts disagree with the high market price, seeing it as overvalued, but there is notable confusion over whether it involves the NHL or NBA. Market 3 generates the most disagreement, with analysts split on whether Boise State's probability is undervalued enough to present a >10% edge.",

However, a military engagement is unlikely given the lack of credible reports confirming such an event by December 13, making the market price nearly accurate.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 80%  \nMarket Price: 90%  \nEdge: -10% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -10%  \nReasoning: Although Utah Jazz recently won against the Memphis Grizzlies, their prior performance was weak, including a significant loss to the Thunder.

Given there's no military engagement occurring and only diplomatic/economic tensions (migrant flights, tanker seizure), the probability of actual military engagement today is essentially 0%.

Washington (8-4) is transitioning in the Big Ten. Boise State typically performs well in bowl games and has the better recent momentum. The 24% market price significantly undervalues Boise State's chances in what should be a competitive matchup.",

Based on the news context showing only diplomatic tensions (migrant disputes, oil tanker seizure), there is no indication of imminent military action today. However, the market is already pricing this at 96.9% NO (3.1% YES), which correctly reflects the extremely low probability. The edge favors NO but the payout is minimal (~3% return) and not worth the capital deployment.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market is correctly priced, insufficient edge for profitable trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: N/A\nMarket Price: 90.0%\nEdge: Cannot calculate\nExpected Value: N/A\nReasoning: This appears to be an NHL betting market (Seattle vs Utah Hockey Club with -1.5 spread), but the context provided discusses the NBA's Utah Jazz basketball team. The search results are completely irrelevant to the actual market. Without proper information about the NHL teams' recent performance, injuries, or matchup dynamics, I cannot make an informed probability assessment.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Insufficient relevant data to assess true probability.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 24.0%\nEdge: +21% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +21% \u00d7 3.17x payout = +66.6% EV\nReasoning: Boise State (9-4, Mountain West champions) is significantly undervalued against Washington (8-4). The Broncos just won their conference championship with a dominant 38-21 victory, demonstrating strong momentum. The $12,000 recent bet on Boise State suggests sharp money recognizes this value. Washington's 5-4 Big Ten record is less impressive than Boise's 6-2 conference performance. Bowl games often favor motivated conference champions, and 24% odds for a competitive 9-4 team seems like a clear mispricing.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge, back Boise State at 24% (true odds closer to 45%).",
