  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge to bet NO on Market 2, as all AIs agree the forecasted 40\u00b0F high makes the 42-43\u00b0F range highly improbable versus its 86% market price. For Market 1, most analysts find the 95.9% price for both teams to score is overvalued, but they disagree on whether it presents a sufficient edge to trade. Regarding Market 3, opinions on Heroic's advantage are mixed, resulting in no clear trading consensus as estimated edges generally fall below the 10% threshold.",

Typical BTTS rates in Championship matches hover around 50-60%. However, the market structure may indicate this has already resolved or there's something I'm missing.
