  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for betting \"YES\" on SpaceX's $1T+ IPO market cap and Birmingham City FC's win, as both AI models recommending trades see significant probability gaps versus market prices. All analysts agree there is insufficient edge to trade the Florida State Seminoles game, as the market price accurately reflects their high likelihood of winning. Therefore, actionable trades are only recommended for Markets 1 and 3, where multiple models calculate a >10% edge.",
