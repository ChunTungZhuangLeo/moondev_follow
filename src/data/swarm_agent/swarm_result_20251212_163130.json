  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends a YES trade on Market 2, as all models agree Villarreal has a high win probability (70-75%) against last-place Levante, creating a significant edge over the 58% market price. For Market 1, most analysts see a slight edge for the Over but deem it insufficient for trading, while opinions on Market 3 unanimously agree the \"No\" side is drastically undervalued, though its speculative nature makes a formal trade recommendation inconsistent. Overall, Market 2 is the only clear, actionable opportunity meeting the 10% edge threshold based on the provided analysis.",

Both teams have shown offensive capability recently (Seattle's 3-2 OT win, Utah's 4-3 loss with Guenther scoring twice). The over/under of 5.5 goals is reasonable given both teams' recent scoring trends, but the 3% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold for a trade recommendation.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 58%\nEdge: +14% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong (+14% edge \u00d7 1.72x payout = +24% EV)\nReasoning: Villarreal is 3rd in LaLiga with 35 points and coming off a 2-0 win, while Levante is dead last in the league table and struggling badly. Betting odds of 1.75 for Villarreal away win suggest ~57% probability, but given the extreme gap in form and league position (3rd vs last place), the true probability is significantly higher.

The Second Coming of Christ is a theological event with no empirical basis for prediction or timeline.
