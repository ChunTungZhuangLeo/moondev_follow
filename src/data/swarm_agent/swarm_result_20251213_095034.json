Pritzker has been making moves that suggest an interest in a presidential run, such as fundraising and national engagement, he has not officially announced his candidacy. The market is speculative at this stage, and without a formal declaration, it's too uncertain to take a position.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Parma's tendency to have high-scoring home games, Lazio's recent performance shows consistent under 2.5 goals outcomes, with all six of their recent matches ending under this threshold. Given Lazio's defensive record, betting on under 2.5 goals aligns with the trend.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Sydney FC is in strong form, having won five of their last six matches and having a dominant head-to-head record against Perth Glory FC. Despite Perth's recent improvement, Sydney's current performance makes them the more likely winner.",

While he is positioning himself with fundraising and public appearances, this does not equate to a 59% chance of securing the nomination.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The market is priced at $900.00 for Under 2.5 goals, reflecting a 90% probability. While SS Lazio has seen all six of their recent matches end with under 2.5 goals, Parma Calcio has had 4 out of their last 6 matches feature over 2.5 goals and 60% of their home games are over 2.5 goals, creating conflicting trends that make such a high conviction bet on \"Under\" risky.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning:",
