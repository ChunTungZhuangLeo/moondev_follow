  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as the clearest opportunity, with all AIs agreeing the market overvalues 9INE (67.9% price) given their poor recent form, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Market 1, most analysts see a slight Cavaliers edge but find it insufficient for a 10%+ trade, resulting in a \"NO_TRADE\" consensus. Opinions diverge sharply on Market 3, where one model strongly recommends \"YES\" while others see no actionable edge, indicating high uncertainty.",

A 14.5 spread is large but reasonable given the talent disparity. However, Cleveland's recent form makes covering uncertain.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\nMARKET 2: 9INE vs SPARTA (BO3)\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -17.9%\nExpected Value: 17.9% \u00d7 3.12 = +55.8% (betting NO/SPARTA)\nReasoning: 9INE has a dismal 20% win rate in the last month, indicating severe form issues. SPARTA showed resilience in group stage and recently qualified for playoffs. The market is heavily overvaluing 9INE based on historical reputation rather than current form.

Head-to-head is nearly even (8-7 DK). The 68.9% price for DK seems too high for what should be closer to a coin flip between two elite teams in peak form.

However, Cavs have lost 5 of last 7 games showing vulnerability. The 52% market price for covering -14.5 seems reasonable given Cavs' recent inconsistency - they can win but may not blow out by 15+.

SPARTA showed resilience qualifying through playoffs and has momentum. 9INE's recent form is abysmal - this is a classic case of market not adjusting quickly enough to recent performance data.
