  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on Market 2 (Bulls -3.5) due to a consistent view that the market overvalues the struggling Bulls, providing a clear edge. For Market 1, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" but all agree the 96.7% price is significantly overconfident given the unresolved diplomatic process. On Market 3, there is disagreement on direction, with no clear consensus for a trade meeting the 10% edge threshold.",

With only ~19 days left in 2025, formal accession requires significant diplomatic process. The Armenia-Azerbaijan peace process remains unresolved, which officials stated as a precondition.

While they're favored by 3.5, a team in this much of a slump covering against any opponent is questionable.
