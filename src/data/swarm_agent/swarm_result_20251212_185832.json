There is strong agreement that Market 3 is significantly overvalued by bettors, while Markets 1 and 2 are generally viewed as fairly or slightly mispriced, but not enough to be actionable.

While they have the potential to cover the spread, the probability is not significantly higher than the market price to justify a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 85%  \nMarket Price: 77.8%  \nEdge: +7.2% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +7.2% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Heroic is a strong favorite against Pipsqueak+4 due to their higher ranking and better recent performance, supported by community predictions. However, the market already heavily favors Heroic, and while they are likely to win, the edge is not sufficient to recommend a trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 80%  \nMarket Price: 92.8%  \nEdge: -12.8% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -12.8% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite being favored, Eintracht Braunschweig's recent form and position near the bottom of the league table suggest vulnerability.

Their recent 5-2 loss to Boston shows defensive vulnerabilities, and while they beat Ottawa 2-1, that wouldn't have covered this spread. The +190 odds (~34%) from sportsbooks align with market pricing, suggesting fair value.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient for trade\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 Pipsqueak+4, but their recent form (6-4) isn't dominant. Community predictions at 97% seem overconfident. Game 1 of a Bo3 has higher variance, and upsets happen. The 77.8% price already reflects Heroic's advantage but may slightly overvalue them given esports volatility.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Extremely high on NO side\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. Braunschweig is 14th, Dresden is 17th - both struggling teams. Braunschweig has 1W-1D-3L in last 5 matches and is playing AWAY at Dresden's stadium. No away team in this matchup should be 92.8% favorites. Typical away win probability in such matches is 25-40%.\n\n**Decision: NO**",
