      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: NAVI is set to face FURIA in the grand final, a team that has already dominated them earlier in the tournament. Expert analyses had placed NAVI's chances of winning at a mere 4%, significantly lower than FURIA's 32%. Given NAVI's recent loss to FURIA and the expert assessments, the likelihood of NAVI winning the Major appears low.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While PhantomFX shows significant growth with a 140.91% year-on-year income increase and a substantial order book, the specific details on daily builder revenue remain unspecified. Without clear data on daily revenue figures, taking a position on this market lacks sufficient information.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The Jaguars are heavily favored by 13.5 points and have demonstrated strong performance with a four-game winning streak, including a significant victory over the Colts. In contrast, the Jets are struggling with a 3-10 record and quarterback issues. The Jaguars covering the spread seems likely given these circumstances.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: NAVI is in the grand final against FURIA, but they were already dominated 13-2 by FURIA in Stage 3. Pre-tournament odds gave NAVI only 4% chance vs FURIA's 32%, and FURIA has shown clear superiority in their head-to-head matchup.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The search results discuss PhantomFX (a VFX studio), not Phantom wallet - this is irrelevant context. However, with only ~18 days left in 2025 and a large recent trade on No ($8.5k), the market suggests $300k daily revenue is unlikely to be achieved.\n\nMARKET 3: NO (bet on Jets +13.5)\nReasoning: A 13.5-point spread is very large in the NFL. While the Jaguars are hot with 4 straight wins and the Jets are struggling at 3-10, NFL games rarely see such large margins. The Jets should be able to keep it within two touchdowns even with their QB issues.",

The recent $1,638 bet on No aligns with FURIA being the stronger favorite.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This market appears to be about Phantom wallet's builder revenue, but the search results provided information about PhantomFX (a VFX studio), which is a completely different company. Without accurate data on Phantom wallet's actual daily revenue metrics, I cannot make an informed prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The recent $3,048 trade on Jets (+13.5) is well-justified - the Jaguars are giving 13.5 points but the Jets' quarterback situation with injuries to Taylor and Fields creates significant uncertainty. A 13.5-point spread is extremely large in the NFL, and even struggling teams can often cover such massive spreads.",
