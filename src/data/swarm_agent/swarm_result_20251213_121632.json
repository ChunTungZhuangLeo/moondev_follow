      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: RCD Mallorca has shown a tendency to draw matches recently, with two draws in their last games. Elche CF's recent win suggests improved form, but they haven't won any away matches this season. The mixed signals and betting already leaning towards \"No\" make this a less clear-cut market to trade on.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite the recent trade favoring the over, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach has shown strong home form, while Wolfsburg has been lackluster away. Their last encounter ended 1-0, suggesting a tighter match that may not exceed 3.5 goals. The recent form and head-to-head result point towards a lower-scoring game.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Stoke City has been in poor form with five losses in their last six matches, including a heavy defeat to Sheffield United. Although Swansea City has struggled in away games, the significant amount of recent trade on \"No\" reflects the market's lack of confidence in a Stoke City victory, which aligns with their recent performance.",
