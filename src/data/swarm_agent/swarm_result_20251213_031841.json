Their success in the tournament so far and significant viewership support make them a favorable contender to win.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The trend in December shows a noticeable decrease in matches ending with over 2.5 goals across various leagues. Considering this shift, it is likely that the total goals in upcoming matches will also trend towards under 2.5.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Similar to Market 2, the overall trend for December indicates a decrease in matches with over 2.5 goals. This suggests that matches are more likely to end with fewer total goals, making a bet on under 2.5 goals more attractive.",
