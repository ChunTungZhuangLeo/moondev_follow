The announcement is for next year, not this year. However, the market is already pricing this correctly at 97.5% NO (2.5% YES), meaning very low chance it happens in 2025.

Despite Cavs' recent 5-7 stretch, they're facing a historically weak Wizards team. The 14.5 spread is reasonable given the massive talent gap, and 68% probability to cover is significantly higher than the 52% market price.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -15.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive on NO side\nReasoning: 9INE has only a 20% win rate over the past month showing terrible recent form, while SPARTA showed resilience advancing through playoffs. The market is significantly overvaluing 9INE at 67.9% despite their recent struggles. This is a clear bet on SPARTA (NO side) with nearly 16% edge.",

The announcement itself likely satisfies the market resolution criteria for \"creating\" a tariff dividend in 2025, even if payments come later.

Covering 14.5 points is a massive spread even against a terrible team when Cleveland is struggling. The matchup favors Cavs but covering such a large spread is closer to a coin flip.\n\nDecision: **NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Counter-Strike: 9INE vs SPARTA (BO3)**\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -12.9%\nExpected Value: ~25% return on NO bet\nReasoning: 9INE has a dismal 20% win rate over the past month, indicating severe form issues. SPARTA showed resilience in advancing through the group stage with a decisive win over FORZE Reload. The market is overvaluing 9INE based on historical reputation while ignoring their current slump.
