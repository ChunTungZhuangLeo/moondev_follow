  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting NO on Market 2, as all AIs agree the 97.1% market price is a severe overestimate compared to a true probability between 5-75%. For Markets 1 and 3, most AIs find the edges too small (under 10%) to recommend a trade, though there is minor disagreement on the exact probabilities. Overall, the only clear actionable trade with a significant perceived edge is against the \"YES\" outcome in the Lighter market cap question.",

Home advantage and better league position support roughly 55% win probability, essentially matching the market price.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -82.1%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The search results appear contradictory - Polymarket shows 97.1% YES but another source mentions 2.1% chance. Given Lighter was valued at $1.5B in November 2025, reaching $10B FDV (6.7x increase) one day after launch would require extraordinary circumstances. Even with strong trading volume, such immediate valuation jumps are extremely rare.

However, Spurs showed strong form beating Lakers with Castle's return.

Home advantage and opponent's poor form (18th place) suggest slight edge, but only 2% edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -92.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong negative edge favors NO position\nReasoning: Lighter just raised $68M at $1.5B valuation in November 2025. Reaching $10B FDV one day after token launch would require a 6.7x valuation jump. Even with strong volume ($10.7B/24h), this is extremely unlikely - most tokens decline post-launch. Market severely overpricing YES.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO** - The market is pricing this at 97.1% when realistic probability is ~5%. This represents massive mispricing. Recent funding at $1.5B valuation makes $10B FDV next-day highly improbable.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: +4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Marginal (~$4 per $100 wagered)\nReasoning: Thunder on historic 16-game win streak, 24-1 record, and demolished Suns 138-89. They're playing at peak performance with Gilgeous-Alexander and Holmgren dominant. Spurs won but less convincingly. Thunder's momentum and superior form justify slightly higher probability, but 4% edge is below threshold.\n\n**Note:** While Thunder look strong, the 4% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold for a recommended trade.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n**STRONG TRADE RECOMMENDATION:** Market 2 - BET NO on Lighter >$10B FDV\n- Massive 92% edge in favor of NO\n- Recent $1.5B valuation makes $10B target unrealistic in one day\n- Market is severely mispriced at 97.1% YES",
