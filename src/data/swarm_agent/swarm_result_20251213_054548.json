There is notable disagreement on the esports market, with one model strongly favoring T1 while others see value in Dplus KIA. For the NVIDIA market, all models agree the stock closing in the $160\u2013165 range is highly improbable given its current price far above that band.",

The market appears to overvalue the probability of the game going over 224.5 points.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 67.6%\nEdge: -12.6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$1.26 (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)\nReasoning: Although T1 won the series against Dplus KIA, Dplus KIA's dominant victory in previous Game 1 matchups indicates they have a strong chance. The market seems to overestimate T1's likelihood of winning Game 1, providing an opportunity to bet on Dplus KIA.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 93.6%\nEdge: -88.6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$8.86 (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)\nReasoning: Given that NVIDIA's stock is currently trading at $175.02, significantly above the $160-$165 range, the probability of it closing in that range by the end of 2025 is very low. The market is heavily overvaluing the chance of this outcome.",

Wembanyama returning on minutes restriction means limited offensive output from the Spurs' best player. NBA Cup semifinal intensity typically leads to tighter defensive games.
