Launched recently, Gemini 3 Deep Think is designed for complex reasoning tasks, such as advanced mathematics, science, and logic. It employs advanced parallel reasoning to evaluate multiple hypotheses simultaneously, achieving unprecedented results on major benchmarks like Humanity\u2019s Last Exam and ARC-AGI-2.

Despite the competitive threat posed by Gemini 3, OpenAI's metrics have been less impacted than anticipated.

Team Tidebound's consistent performance over the past year provides them an edge, but not enough to recommend a decisive trade given the marginal edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 30%  \nMarket Price: 25.2%  \nEdge: +4.8% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +$0.048 per dollar wagered  \nReasoning: Natus Vincere has a better recent win rate and a higher ranking than Yakutou Brothers, suggesting they are the favorites. However, the edge is below the 10% threshold needed for a strong recommendation, so a NO_TRADE stance is advised.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 85%  \nMarket Price: 82.0%  \nEdge: +3% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +$0.03 per dollar wagered  \nReasoning: Google's recent launch of Gemini 3 Deep Think, with its impressive performance on major AI benchmarks, supports a high probability of them having the top AI model.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 30%\nMarket Price: 31.1%\nEdge: -1.1%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Passion UA's recent form is poor (4 losses in last 5 matches, 40% monthly win rate) while Team Tidebound maintains a solid 56% win rate. The market price of 31.1% seems reasonably accurate given Passion UA's struggles against better teams.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 25.2%\nEdge: -13.2%\nExpected Value: ~17.6% return on NO position\nReasoning: Na'Vi is ranked 10th globally with 60% recent win rate versus Yakutou Brothers at 16th with only 40% win rate. The market is pricing Yakutou Brothers' chances far too high at 25.2% - Na'Vi should be heavy favorites in this BO3, likely around 85-90% to win. The $2,000 trade on Yakutou Brothers appears to be misinformed money.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 82.0%\nEdge: -2%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think is currently leading on major benchmarks, and with only ~19 days until December 31, it's unlikely OpenAI's GPT-5.2 or another competitor will definitively surpass it. The 82% price accurately reflects Google's strong position while accounting for the small possibility of a late competitor release or benchmark revision.",

However, Passion UA's 51% 6-month rate suggests capability. The market price of 31.1% already reflects Passion UA as underdog, and my edge of only 3.9% is insufficient for a confident trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge below 10% threshold\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Dota 2: Natus Vincere vs Yakutou Brothers (BO3)**\n\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 25.2%\nEdge: +44.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive - but bet on OPPOSITE side (Na'Vi to WIN)\nReasoning: Na'Vi holds 60% recent win rate vs Yakutou's 40%, ranked 10th vs 16th globally. The market is pricing Yakutou Brothers at 74.8% (100% - 25.2%), which severely overvalues them. This appears to be influenced by the recent $2,000 trade on Yakutou Brothers, creating mispricing.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Bet against Yakutou Brothers (equivalent to betting Na'Vi wins) with massive 44.8% edge\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Will Google have the top AI model on December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 82.0%\nEdge: -7.0% (Your prob - Market)\nReasoning: While Gemini 3 Deep Think shows impressive benchmarks and current leadership, the 19-day window until December 31st creates uncertainty. OpenAI's GPT-5.2 release and rapid development pace, plus potential announcements from Anthropic or others, mean Google's dominance isn't as certain as 82% implies. However, edge of -7% is below my 10% threshold.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge of 7% insufficient, though slight overvaluation of Google exists\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- Market 1: NO_TRADE (insufficient edge)\n- Market 2: **NO on Yakutou Brothers** (44.8% edge - STRONG BET)\n- Market 3: NO_TRADE (edge below threshold)\n\nOnly Market 2 presents actionable opportunity with significant edge above 10% threshold.",
