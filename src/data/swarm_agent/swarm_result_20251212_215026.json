  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's \"YES\" probability as significantly overpriced given the reported viewership drop, though estimates on the true probability vary widely. For Markets 2 and 3, there is major disagreement on both true probabilities and edge, with no trade recommendation achieving clear majority support. Overall, while Market 1 shows the strongest collective skepticism, the lack of reliable agreement on precise values across all models makes any single high-conviction trade difficult to isolate.",
