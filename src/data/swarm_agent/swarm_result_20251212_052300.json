Recent achievements by top athletes like Johannes H\u00f8sflot Kl\u00e6bo and Johannes Thingnes B\u00f8, coupled with Norway's strategic focus on winter sports, strongly suggest that they are likely to lead the medal tally in 2026.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite an increase in Israel's defense budget, there is no current evidence of imminent plans for a major ground offensive in Lebanon. The focus on diplomatic measures and the UN's decision to wind down the UNIFIL mission indicate a preference for stability over escalation.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The Vancouver Surge is currently struggling, having been labeled as the weakest team in the league, while Toronto KOI recently secured a victory in their opening match. Given the Surge's poor performance, Toronto KOI is favored to win the upcoming match.",
