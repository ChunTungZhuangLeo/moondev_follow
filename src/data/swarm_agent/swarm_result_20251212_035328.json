([kotaku.com](https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-kabuto-first-edition-viral-card-2000649100?utm_source=openai)) This trend has continued, with recent data indicating that the card's value has climbed 1,397% between August and December 2025, reaching over $38. ([wargamer.com](https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/kabuto-king-first-edition-collection-prices?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn early December, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card, raising $51,100 for charity.

However, recent developments provide insight into the Fed's current stance and future expectations:\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps, bringing it to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%. This marked the third consecutive rate cut, a trend not seen since 2019.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for buying \"YES\" on the Kabuto card market, with most models seeing its rapid price surge as undervalued at 40%. For the NBA game, analysts agree the Bulls are overvalued but disagree on whether betting against them offers a full 10% edge. Regarding the Fed decision, models generally see the market price as accurate, offering no clear trading opportunity.",

Road games are typically harder, and the Bulls' recent 32-point blowout loss to GSW suggests serious issues. However, Hornets have their own problems and injury concerns (report cut off).

While \"Kabuto King\" has driven prices up significantly, the momentum appears to be slowing, and such speculative bubbles often plateau or correct.

With GDP growth revised UP to 2.3% and inflation still above target at 2.4%, the Fed is likely to PAUSE in January to assess impacts.

The market is overvaluing Bulls' brand name despite their current collapse. Bulls' 123-91 blowout loss shows they're in freefall. Hornets have home court advantage and rest advantage after their tough schedule.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto 1st Edition Card hits $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability: 15%**\n**Market Price: 40%**\n**Edge: -25% (Your prob - Market)**\n**Expected Value: -25% \u00d7 2.5 payout = -62.5%**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** Card is currently at ~$38 after rising 1,397% from under $1. To reach $100 requires another 163% gain in just 19 days. The Kabuto King phenomenon has already driven massive speculation, and the charity auction ($51k) suggests peak attention has passed.

With economy strengthening and three cuts already delivered, the Fed will likely pause in January to assess impact.
