  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear mispricing in Market 2 (Lighter FDV), with most AIs recommending a YES trade due to a significant edge from conflicting probability data. For Market 3 (Rubio), all agree the current price is vastly overvalued, strongly recommending a NO bet. Opinions diverge on Market 1 (Angers), with no strong consensus on a trade due to mixed probability assessments and insufficient edge.",

While Angers has decent home form (3 wins in 7) and Nantes is struggling, a 55% implied probability for a home win against a struggling opponent is slightly high. Angers' home win rate of ~43% suggests the market is overpriced. The draw is a significant factor in French football.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$3B one day after launch?**\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: +5.1%\nExpected Value: 5.1% \u00d7 2.0 = +10.2%\nReasoning: The search results indicate Polymarket itself shows 68% probability for >$3B FDV, with substantial trading volume ($15M+) and strong market interest. The 49.9% shown here appears to be stale or from a different snapshot. However, crypto launches are highly volatile and the 68% figure may already be outdated. Given uncertainty, I estimate 55% true probability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Edge below 10% threshold)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?**\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -92.9%\nExpected Value: Massive positive EV on NO\n\nReasoning: This market price appears to be an error or manipulation. The news clearly shows Rubio himself endorses JD Vance as the likely nominee, and prediction markets in October 2025 gave Rubio only 3.5% chance. Rubio is currently Secretary of State and has indicated support for Vance, not his own candidacy. A 95.9% probability is absurdly mispriced.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Strong conviction - this is either a display error or extreme mispricing)",

Home advantage and recent form favor Angers slightly, but not enough edge for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: +15.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High (15% edge \u00d7 ~2x payout = ~30% EV)\nReasoning: The web context shows Polymarket itself indicates 68% probability for >$3B FDV, yet this market is priced at only 49.9%. This is a clear mispricing - the market hasn't converged to the consensus probability shown in other related Lighter markets. Strong arbitrage opportunity.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -93.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Exceptional (94% edge \u00d7 ~25x payout on NO = massive EV)\nReasoning: This market appears to have a CRITICAL ERROR - 95.9% means \"Will Marco Rubio win\" but context shows he has ~3.5% chance with JD Vance leading at 28%. The market is pricing YES at 95.9% when it should be ~2-4%. This is either a data error or the most mispriced market possible. BET NO HEAVILY.\n\n**URGENT NOTE ON MARKET 3**: This appears to be a severe mispricing or potential scam market. A 95.9% probability for Rubio winning 2028 contradicts all available data showing him at 2-4% chance.
