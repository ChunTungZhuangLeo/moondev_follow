However, several factors provide context for speculation:\n\n**Recent News Articles:**\n- *Chicago Tribune* (December 2025): Reports that Pritzker has been increasing his national profile through appearances at Democratic events and policy forums, fueling speculation about a potential presidential bid.\n- *Politico* (November 2025): Notes that Pritzker has been actively fundraising for Democratic causes, which some interpret as laying the groundwork for a future campaign.\n\n**Official Announcements:**\n- As of now, Governor Pritzker has not made any official announcements regarding a 2028 presidential run.\n\n**Expert Opinions:**\n- Political analysts suggest that Pritzker's substantial financial resources and experience as a two-term governor position him as a strong contender for the 2028 nomination.\n- However, some experts caution ...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Parma Calcio 1913 vs. SS Lazio: O/U 2.5\nRecent trade: $900.00 on Under\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/sea-par-laz-2025-12-13-more-markets\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe upcoming Serie A match between Parma Calcio 1913 and SS Lazio is scheduled for December 13, 2025, at Stadio Ennio Tardini in Parma.

Pritzker is raising his national profile and fundraising, he has not officially announced a 2028 presidential run. The lack of a definitive announcement and mixed expert opinions make it uncertain whether he will secure the nomination, suggesting a cautious approach.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The recent form and statistics for both Parma Calcio 1913 and SS Lazio suggest a low-scoring match. Parma struggles at home and Lazio's solid defense further supports the likelihood of the game finishing with under 2.5 goals, aligning with the market consensus for a low-scoring encounter.",
