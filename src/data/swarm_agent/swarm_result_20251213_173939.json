  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as a clear opportunity, with all AIs agreeing the 86% market price is severely overvalued against a ~25% forecast, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Market 1, most analysts see the 95.9% price as too high but disagree on the edge, leading to a split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations. On Market 3, opinions are divided between \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" reflecting uncertainty despite Heroic's recent victory.",

However, at 95.9%, the market has overpriced this - there's still 10-12% chance of a shutout given Ipswich's decent defense (0.8 conceded per game).
