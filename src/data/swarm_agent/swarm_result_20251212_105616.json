      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Marco Rubio has not declared his candidacy and is currently supporting JD Vance for the 2028 Republican nomination, who is leading the Republican field in polls. Rubio's low support in polls further suggests he is an unlikely candidate to win the 2028 Presidential Election.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The race for Portugal's 2026 presidential election is highly competitive, with varying poll results showing different leaders. Although Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes is a leading candidate, the close competition with other candidates like Henrique Gouveia e Melo and Andr\u00e9 Ventura suggests uncertainty.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Elche CF is performing better than Real Mallorca this season, with both teams having similar win records but Mallorca having more losses. Additionally, Elche CF's key player, Rafa Mir, is in good form, making them a likely contender to win the match on December 13, 2025.",

      "response": "**MARKET 1: NO**\nReasoning: Rubio has only 4% support in polls compared to JD Vance's 53%, and he has publicly and privately backed Vance for 2028 rather than positioning himself to run. The probability of him winning is extremely low.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\nReasoning: The polling is highly competitive with Marques Mendes leading in some polls (22.6%) but trailing in others (16%), and with multiple strong candidates including Gouveia e Melo and Ventura. Too much uncertainty to take a confident position without knowing the current market price.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO**\nReasoning: Elche CF is playing away at Real Mallorca's home stadium, and despite Mallorca's lower league position, home advantage is significant. Elche's modest record (3W-6D-3L) doesn't suggest they're strong favorites to win away, making a \"Yes\" bet unattractive.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Rubio has publicly endorsed JD Vance for 2028 and is focused on his Secretary of State role. Polls show Vance leading with 53% GOP support while Rubio has only 4%, indicating he's not positioned to win the nomination or general election.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The race is extremely tight with multiple polls showing different leaders (Marques Mendes 22.6%, Gouveia e Melo 21.1%, Ventura 18%). With such volatility and no clear frontrunner 2+ months before the election, the outcome is too uncertain for a confident position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Elche (11th place, away) faces Mallorca (16th place, home advantage). While both teams have struggled, Mallorca playing at home against a mid-table opponent makes an Elche win unlikely. The recent trade on Yes at $514.91 appears optimistic given the circumstances.",
