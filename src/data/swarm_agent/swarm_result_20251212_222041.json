  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no trades with a sufficient 10%+ edge, as most models find the market prices fairly efficient or offering only minimal value. There is notable disagreement on Market 2 (Leverkusen), where assessments of their true win probability range from 45% to 75%, creating both \"YES\" and \"NO\" recommendations. Overall, the analysis suggests passing on all three markets due to a lack of clear, high-conviction opportunities.",

However, the market price already reflects a high probability, leaving minimal edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 55%  \nMarket Price: 62.0%  \nEdge: -7% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -7 \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: While Bayer Leverkusen has a strong head-to-head record against K\u00f6ln, recent performances, including a draw in the Champions League and a loss in the Bundesliga, expose vulnerabilities.

The market price is slightly high but within reasonable range given the show's continued dominance.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 62%\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Minimal positive\nReasoning: Leverkusen has a strong head-to-head record (4 wins in last 5) against K\u00f6ln and plays at home at BayArena, but their recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg shows defensive vulnerabilities. The market appears fairly priced given the mixed recent form despite favorable historical matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: YES (on KK Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 74%\nEdge: +4%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has a significantly better EuroLeague record (9-5) compared to Partizan (5-9), and recent form favors them despite Partizan's home advantage.

The market date is December 16, which would be week 3-4 after premiere. Historical patterns show continued decline is likely, but it should still be #1 given the massive initial lead.
