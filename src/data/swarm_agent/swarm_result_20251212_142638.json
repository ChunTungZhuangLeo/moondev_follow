However, recent developments provide context for predicting its potential viewership.\n\nIn November 2025, MrBeast launched \"Beast Land,\" a theme park in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, featuring endurance-style challenges similar to those in his videos. This initiative aims to engage his global audience and expand his brand presence in the Middle East. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/worlds-top-youtuber-mrbeast-launches-saudi-theme-park-2025-11-13/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, MrBeast announced the premiere of \"Beast Games\" Season 2 on January 7, 2026, on Prime Video.

This Ligue 1 match is crucial for both teams, with Metz struggling at the bottom of the table and PSG aiming to maintain their position at the top.\n\n**Recent Form and Performance:**\n\n- **FC Metz:** Currently 18th in Ligue 1 with 11 points from 15 matches, Metz has suffered three consecutive losses, conceding nine goals in that span. Their recent form includes a 1-3 defeat to AJ Auxerre.

Despite this, discussions about his potential involvement in the 2028 election have emerged.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Public Remarks:** In October 2025, President Trump stated he \"would love\" to serve a third term, despite acknowledging constitutional constraints. He also suggested that Vice President J.D. Vance is \"most likely\" to secure the Republican Party nomination for the 2028 election. ([aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/trump-rules-out-vp-run-in-2028-but-says-he-would-love-a-third-term?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Legal Perspectives:** House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed skepticism about amending the Constitution to allow a third term for Trump, noting the complexity of such a process.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as a clear opportunity, with all AIs agreeing the 93.2% price for an FC Metz win is a severe mispricing and strongly recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Market 3, there is unanimous agreement that a \"NO\" bet holds a massive edge due to constitutional barriers for Trump. Regarding Market 1, opinions on the true probability vary, leading to a split between \"NO_TRADE\" and \"NO\" recommendations, indicating no strong consensus for a high-conviction trade.",

His recent acknowledgment that some videos underperformed, plus the specific 70-80M range (not just \"over 70M\"), introduces meaningful variance. However, betting NO at 3.7% requires the video to fall outside this range, which is unlikely given his track record.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 93.2%\nEdge: -90.2%\nExpected Value: Massive (betting NO at 6.8% when true prob ~97% for PSG)\nReasoning: This market appears INVERTED or mislabeled. FC Metz (18th place, 3 consecutive losses) playing PSG (2nd place, dominant form with 5-0 wins) has virtually no chance of winning. The 93.2% YES price for Metz winning is absurd - PSG should be ~90%+ favorites. The $7,000 NO trade confirms smart money sees this mispricing. Bet NO heavily.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 1%\nMarket Price: 95.7%\nEdge: -94.7%\nExpected Value: Extremely high (betting NO at 4.3% when true prob ~99%)\nReasoning: Trump is CONSTITUTIONALLY INELIGIBLE under the 22nd Amendment - he cannot run for a third term. Constitutional amendments require 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of states, which is effectively impossible by 2028. Even House Speaker Johnson dismissed this. The 95.7% YES price is completely irrational - this should resolve NO with near certainty. Bet NO aggressively.",

Metz is 18th place with 3 straight losses, facing 2nd-place PSG who won 5-0 recently. The 93.2% is severely mispriced - this appears to be the probability PSG wins, not Metz. Metz winning is extremely unlikely (~8% realistic probability).\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 95.7%\nEdge: -93.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Massive positive on NO side\nReasoning: The 22nd Amendment explicitly prohibits Trump from running for a third term.
