  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as severely mispriced with a strong agreement to bet \"NO,\" as all models find the 97.1% market price vastly overstates the true probability. For Markets 1 and 3, the analyses converge on \"NO_TRADE,\" as estimated edges are either too small or negative, failing to meet the 10% threshold. Notably, the only significant disagreement is on the precise true probability for Market 2, though all agree it is dramatically lower than the market price.",

Home advantage in LaLiga typically adds 5-8% win probability. The 56% market price is fairly efficient given the matchup dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -92.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Excellent (~$18.42 per $1 NO bet if correct)\nReasoning: The market is severely mispriced. Earlier data showed 72% for >$1B and 67% for >$2B FDV, making >$10B (5-10x higher) extremely unlikely. The recent $1,441 NO trade and shift from high probability to 2.1% on other platforms suggests reality is setting in. This is a strong NO position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -3% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Thunder is on a historic 16-game win streak and 24-1 record, making them heavy favorites. However, 81% might be slightly overvaluing them - NBA Cup single-elimination games are more volatile, and the Spurs just showed strong form beating the Lakers with Castle's breakout performance. Edge is insufficient for a trade recommendation.",

Home advantage roughly balances out both teams' poor form.

The market price shows 97.1% but the web search says Polymarket itself shows 2.1% probability. There appears to be a data discrepancy.

They're playing at an historically elite level. While Spurs had a nice win over Lakers, the Thunder's dominance this season makes them heavy favorites - 81% actually underprices their chances in this semifinal matchup.",
