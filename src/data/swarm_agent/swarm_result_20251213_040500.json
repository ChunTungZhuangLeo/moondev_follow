The 85.2% price shown appears to be a data error or this is a different bucket - based on the actual market data cited, this outcome is highly unlikely. Musk typically tweets far more than 280-299 in a week.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: -1% (28% - 29%)\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after beating Falcons 2-0, meaning they need to win 2 more matches (semifinal + final). With 4 teams remaining, a ~25-30% win probability is reasonable given their strong performance but still needing two wins against top competition. Market is fairly priced.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match TS7 vs VIT)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5% (55% - 50%)\nExpected Value: Low (5% \u00d7 ~100% payout = 5%)\nReasoning: This is a CS2 esports match (best-of-3 format based on context), not soccer. Over 2.5 games means a 2-1 scoreline. In competitive CS2, approximately 50-60% of BO3 matches go to 3 maps when teams are evenly matched. The 50% price is reasonable; my slight lean to Over doesn't meet the 10% edge threshold.\n\n---",

The 85.2% appears to be a data error or misread. Based on Musk's historical patterns showing higher tweet volumes, 280-299 is unlikely. However, this extreme discrepancy suggests possible market structure confusion - NO_TRADE until clarified.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (~+55% return on YES bet)\nReasoning: Team Spirit just defeated Falcons 2-0 in quarterfinals, leads tournament viewership at 560k average, and entered as top contender (5.50 odds = ~18% implied). They're in semifinals with momentum. Market at 29% significantly undervalues their chances given current form and positioning. With only 2-4 teams remaining, their true probability should be 35-50%.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal positive\nReasoning: This appears to be Team Spirit vs Vitality CS2 match. Without specific team scoring data, general esports BO3 trends suggest slightly over 50% for Over 2.5 maps. However, 5% edge is below the 10% threshold for recommended trading.
