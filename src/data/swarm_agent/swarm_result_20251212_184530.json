      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: The U.S. Senate has recently failed to pass legislation extending the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, with both Democratic and Republican proposals rejected. With these credits set to expire soon and no legislative agreement in place, it's unlikely they will be extended in 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Despite both teams struggling recently, Nigma Galaxy has a significantly higher global ranking (14th) compared to Team Nemesis (73rd). This suggests that Nigma Galaxy has a stronger team overall, making them more likely to win the match.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Hertha BSC has demonstrated strong recent form with four wins in their last five matches and a decisive victory in their previous encounter with Greuther F\u00fcrth. Given F\u00fcrth's recent struggles and defensive vulnerabilities, Hertha BSC is favored to win.",

The market's recent trade also heavily favors Nigma Galaxy.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Hertha BSC has shown strong recent form with four wins in their last five matches, including a decisive 5-0 victory against Greuther F\u00fcrth.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The news clearly states that as of December 12, 2025, the Senate has failed to pass legislation extending the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, with both Democratic and Republican proposals rejected. With subsidies expiring January 1, 2026, and no viable path forward, extension in 2025 appears unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Despite both teams being on losing streaks, Nigma Galaxy (ranked 14th globally) has a significant ranking advantage over Team Nemesis (ranked 73rd). The skill gap between a top-15 team and a team outside the top 70 should favor Nigma Galaxy in this BO3 matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Hertha BSC has won 4 of their last 5 matches including a dominant 5-0 victory over Greuther F\u00fcrth recently, while F\u00fcrth has only 1 win in their last 5 and has shown defensive weaknesses. The form differential strongly favors Hertha.",

With only weeks left in the year and House bipartisan efforts still ongoing, the timing is too uncertain to take a confident position.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams are in poor form (Nemesis lost last 5, Nigma lost last 3), with no head-to-head history to reference. While Nigma has better global ranking (14th vs 73rd), recent performance suggests unpredictability in this matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Hertha BSC has won 4 of their last 5 matches and demolished F\u00fcrth 5-0 in their most recent encounter, while F\u00fcrth has only 1 win in their last 5 with defensive vulnerabilities. Strong form and head-to-head advantage make this a compelling bet.",
