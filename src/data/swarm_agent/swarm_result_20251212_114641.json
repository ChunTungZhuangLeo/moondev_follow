  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting NO on Market 3 due to a massive edge, as all models agree the 95.9% market price vastly overvalues Rubio's ~6% true probability. For Market 1, most models recommend NO, agreeing the market's 55% price overvalues the ~44% true win probability for Angers, though one model saw insufficient edge. On Market 2, opinions split between NO and NO_TRADE, reflecting uncertainty but a common view that the true probability is below the market price.",

While Angers has good home form and Nantes is struggling, a home win against a weak opponent in Ligue 1 typically doesn't exceed 45% probability.

The market at 55% appears slightly overvalued on YES, but not enough for a NO trade.

The $3B threshold is 3x higher than the $1B level that was only 72% likely days ago, indicating market is overvaluing YES at 49.9%.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 6%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -89.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +89.9% on NO side\nReasoning: This appears to be a data error or wrong market link. Context shows Rubio at ~6% betting odds for 2028, yet market shows 95.9%. Either this is measuring something different (like \"Will Rubio run?\" not \"win?\") or represents massive mispricing. The 95.9% price is completely disconnected from reality where Rubio has ~6% win probability.\n\n**STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION: Market 3 (NO) - appears to be catastrophic mispricing with 89.9% edge, though verify market resolution criteria before trading.**",
