Launched in early December 2025, Gemini 3 Deep Think is designed for complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks, achieving unprecedented performance on major benchmarks. ([androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-deep-think-is-now-available-in-the-gemini-app-but-only-for-subscribers?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the competitive AI landscape, OpenAI's GPT-5.2, released on December 11, 2025, offers enhanced general intelligence and improved coding capabilities. Despite the competitive threat posed by Gemini 3, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman stated that Gemini 3 had less impact on OpenAI's metrics than anticipated.

On December 11, Russian commanders reported to President Vladimir Putin that their forces had captured Siversk, a town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Putin congratulated the military on this achievement, viewing it as a step toward capturing Sloviansk, another major city in Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commanders-tell-putin-that-russia-has-captured-siversk-eastern-ukraine-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian military has firmly denied these claims. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' Operation Task Force East stated that Siversk remains under Ukrainian control, despite ongoing Russian attempts to infiltrate the area. They also reported continued resistance in the northern districts of Pokrovsk, disputing Russian assertions of control there.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with most analysts recommending a \"NO\" trade due to the credible Ukrainian denial of Russia's capture claim. For Market 1, analysts generally agree there is no clear edge, viewing it as a near coin-flip between major AI competitors. There is significant disagreement on Market 3, stemming from a critical data discrepancy in the reported current price (72% vs. 21%).",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 45.9%\nEdge: +4.1%\nExpected Value: Low positive but insufficient edge\nReasoning: Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think is performing extremely well on benchmarks, but OpenAI's GPT-5/5.2 appears to hold the top position. The race for second place between Google, Anthropic, and xAI is genuinely close, making this near a coin flip - the 4% edge is insufficient to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 89.0%\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge despite high probability\nReasoning: Russian commanders have already reported capturing Siversk to Putin as of December 11, though Ukraine disputes this. With only 19 days remaining and Russia claiming victory, the market seems fairly priced. However, edge is below 10% threshold.\n\n**REVISED DECISION: NO_TRADE** (Edge below 10%)\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 72.0%\nEdge: -47%\nExpected Value: Very high (betting NO at 28 cents for likely 75% probability of winning)\nReasoning: There's a massive discrepancy - the search results show the SAME market trading at only 21% on Polymarket monitoring sites. The 72% price appears stale or incorrect. Crypto token FDV predictions are highly speculative, and comparable markets (Rainbow at 5.3%) suggest this is overpriced. Strong NO bet recommended.",

Google likely competes for second with Anthropic's Claude, but insufficient clarity on final December rankings. Market price seems reasonable given uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 89.0%\nEdge: -74.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +148% on NO position\nReasoning: This is severely mispriced. Ukrainian military explicitly denies Russian control as of Dec 11, stating Siversk remains under Ukrainian control despite infiltration attempts. Russia has claimed captures before that proved premature. With only 19 days left and contested control, 89% is wildly overpriced.\n\n**STRONG NO RECOMMENDATION** - Market hasn't priced in Ukrainian denial. Classic fog-of-war mispricing where Russian claims are being taken at face value.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 72.0%\nEdge: -47.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative for YES, but timing unclear\nReasoning: Context shows this market was at 21% recently but you're showing 72% - significant discrepancy. Without knowing Fogo's launch date, team quality, or comparable token metrics, cannot assess. The recent $720 NO trade suggests informed money doubts the $1B FDV. However, insufficient data to recommend with confidence.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 2 - BET NO**\n- Strongest edge at -74%\n- Clear catalyst: Ukrainian military denial contradicts Russian claims\n- Time constraint (19 days) works against Russia establishing clear control\n- Historical pattern: Russian territorial claims often premature\n- Expected value strongly favors NO position\n\n**Markets 1 & 3: NO_TRADE** - Insufficient edge or clarity to justify positions.",
