  "consensus_summary": "The consensus is to avoid trading on the Portugal election due to a statistical tie in polls, while five of six AIs recommend betting against Panathinaikos covering its spread due to key injuries and poor recent form. There is strong agreement on the Rams covering their spread, with five AIs citing their dominant recent form and the Lions' defensive weaknesses, though one dissenting AI notes Detroit's potent offense could keep the game close. Overall, the group finds the clearest predictive edge in the NFL game, high risk in the soccer match, and excessive uncertainty in the political race.",

      "response": "**Market 1: Will Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes win the 2026 Portugal presidential election?**\n\nMARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Polling shows a very tight race between Marques Mendes (22.6%) and Gouveia e Melo (21.1-26.9%), essentially a statistical tie. Without knowing the current market price, this is too close to call with confidence, and the election is still months away with significant uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Market 2: Spread: Rams (-5.5)**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While the Rams are hot (4-1 in last 5) and playing at home, covering 5.5 points against an 8-5 Lions team with the NFL's 3rd-ranked offense is a tall order. Detroit has the offensive firepower to keep this close, and their defensive struggles may be offset by facing a Rams team that could let up with a lead.\n\n---\n\n**Market 3: Spread: Panathinaik\u00f3s AO (-1.5)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The recent news mentions basketball injuries (Cedi Osman, Richaun Holmes) which appear to be for the basketball team, not football, suggesting some confusion in the context.
