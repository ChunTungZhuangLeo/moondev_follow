For instance, in 2015, Central Park recorded a midday temperature of 66\u00b0F, setting a record for that date. ([newsmobile.in](https://www.newsmobile.in/world/new-york-warm-winter-weather-sets-record/?utm_source=openai)) However, such warm temperatures are uncommon for this time of year.\n\nAdditionally, the New York City Emergency Management Department has issued a Weather Alert for December 13 through December 14, warning of\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Dota 2: Heroic vs Aurora - Game 1 Winner\nCurrent Market Price: 52.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $2,000.00 on Heroic\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/dota2-heroic-aur1-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Heroic and Aurora Gaming are set to face each other in a Best of 3 series during the group stage of the ESL Dota2 2025 DreamLeague Season 27 Main Event.

For Market 3, there is clear agreement to trade \"Yes\" on Heroic, as all models see a significant positive edge versus the market price.",
