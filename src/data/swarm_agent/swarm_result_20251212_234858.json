  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets and provide your predictions.\nYou have been given RECENT NEWS AND CONTEXT from web search for each market.\nUse this information to make more informed predictions.\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Games Total: O/U 3.5\nRecent trade: $2,000.00 on Over\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/lol-dk-t1-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe term \"Games Total: O/U 3.5\" typically refers to betting markets where the over/under (O/U) is set at 3.5 goals or points for a particular game. This is common in sports like soccer and basketball, where bettors predict whether the total goals or points scored will be over or under a specified number.\n\n**Recent Trends in Over/Under 3.5 Goals:**\n\n- **English Premier League (EPL):** In December 2025, 30% of EPL matches (20 games) had over 3.5 goals, while 70% had under 3.5 goals. This is a decrease from November, where 42.9% of games had over 3.5 goals. ([accaplanner.com](https://www.accaplanner.com/league/english-premier-league/over-under-goals/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **La Liga:** Similarly, in December 2025, 15.4% of La Liga matches (13 games) had over 3.5 goals, and 84.6% had under 3.5 goals. This is a significant drop from November, where 32.4% of games had over 3.5 goals.

The most recent development in Meta's AI model lineup is the Llama 4 series, which has experienced several delays due to technical challenges. For instance, the release of Llama 4 was postponed from April to later in the year, as the model did not meet Meta's expectations in key areas such as reasoning and mathematical tasks during benchmark tests. ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-delays-llama-4-ai-model-release-amid-development-challenges--the-information-93CH-3968615?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, Meta is reportedly developing its next-generation flagship large model, codenamed \"Avocado,\" with a target release date in the first quarter of 2026. This model is positioned as the successor to the Llama series and may adopt a closed-source commercial approach to directly compete with other AI models in the market.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/nhl/alexander-wennbergs-ot-goal-caps-sharks-rally-past-maple-leafs--flm-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai)) Prior to that, they snapped an eight-game losing streak against the Carolina Hurricanes with a 4-1 win, highlighted by Macklin Celebrini's goal and two assists.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Meta releasing Llama 5 in 2025, citing delays and a 2026 successor. For the Sharks vs. Penguins game, most models predict a Sharks win based on recent momentum, though one abstained due to incomplete Penguins data. The Games Total market shows the most disagreement, split between abstaining due to irrelevant soccer data and a prediction for \"Over\" based on esports logic.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Given the recent trends in both the English Premier League and La Liga, where a significant majority of matches are going under 3.5 goals (70% and 84.6%, respectively), it suggests a trend towards lower-scoring games. This inclination towards under 3.5 goals makes betting on the under a more favorable position.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: There is no official announcement from Meta about releasing Llama 5 in 2025, and the focus seems to be on the development of the \"Avocado\" model slated for 2026. Furthermore, Llama 4 experienced delays, indicating potential challenges in releasing another version within the same year. This context supports the likelihood that Llama 5 will not be released in 2025.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the Sharks have shown some recent improvement with a couple of wins, their overall performance has been inconsistent, as indicated by their prior eight-game losing streak. The lack of detailed information on the Penguins' recent form in the provided context makes it difficult to confidently predict the outcome of this game, suggesting a cautious approach of no trade.",

Their next flagship model \"Avocado\" is reportedly targeted for Q1 2026, making a Llama 5 release in the remaining weeks of 2025 highly unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The Sharks have momentum with back-to-back wins including an OT victory over Toronto and breaking an 8-game losing streak. The recent $1,000 trade on Sharks suggests sharp money agrees, and they appear to be finding form at the right time against a Penguins team with its own struggles.",

      "response": "Based on the provided news and context, here are my predictions:\n\nMARKET 1: Over\nReasoning: This appears to be for a League of Legends match (DK vs T1 based on the URL), not soccer. In LoL esports, best-of-5 series between top Korean teams like T1 and DK frequently go to 4+ games given their competitive parity, making Over 3.5 games reasonable. The recent $2,000 trade on Over suggests informed money agrees.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: With only ~19 days left in 2025 and no official announcement of Llama 5, plus reports that Llama 4 itself faced delays and Meta's next flagship \"Avocado\" is targeting Q1 2026, it's highly unlikely Llama 5 releases this year. The recent trade of $1,075 on No aligns with this assessment.\n\nMARKET 3: Sharks\nReasoning: The Sharks have momentum with two recent wins including an OT victory over Toronto and ending an 8-game losing streak against Carolina, with Celebrini performing well. While Pittsburgh is the home team, San Jose's recent form and confidence boost make them a reasonable value play here.",
