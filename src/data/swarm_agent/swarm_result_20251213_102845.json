  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Fed rate hike in 2026?\nCurrent Market Price: 90.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $900.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-rate-hike-in-2026\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not announced any plans for an interest rate hike in 2026. In fact, recent actions and projections suggest a cautious approach to monetary policy in the coming year.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Reserve reduced its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.6%, marking its third consecutive rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank may pause further rate changes to observe economic trends, especially in hiring and inflation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/442de589de9b99bb811f76e402b00948?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **2026 Projections:** The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects only one additional rate cut in 2026, maintaining the previous forecast. This indicates a preference for a more cautious approach to monetary policy in the near future.

Recent encounters between these teams have been high-scoring affairs, with 23 goals scored in the last six meetings. ([thehardtackle.com](https://thehardtackle.com/round-up/2025/12/13/liverpool-vs-brighton-preview-and-prediction/?utm_source=openai)) This trend suggests a strong possibility of the match exceeding 3.5 goals.\n\nBetting odds from various bookmakers indicate a preference for a higher-scoring game. For instance, Stake.com offers odds of 2.29 for over 3.5 goals and 1.61 for under 3.5 goals. ([stake.com](https://stake.com/sports/soccer/england/premier-league/46062112-liverpool-fc-brighton-hove-albion?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, Bet365 provides odds of 1.57 for over 2.5 goals, reflecting expectations of a relatively high-scoring match.

This valuation is significantly below the $62 target set for December 31, 2026.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Security Incidents:** In October 2025, a $21 million theft occurred on Hyperliquid due to a private key leak. ([coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/10/usd21m-crypto-theft-on-hyperliquid-tied-to-private-key-leak-peckshield?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, in March 2025, a trader attempted to manipulate the platform's liquidation system, resulting in nearly a $1 million loss. ([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperliquid-exploit-goes-pear-shaped-for-trader-down-1-m-arkham?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Market Volatility:** In October 2025, a significant sell-off led to the liquidation of over 6,300 wallets on Hyperliquid, erasing more than $1.23 billion in trader capital.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that \"NO\" is the correct position for Markets 1 and 3, viewing the market prices as vastly overestimating the probabilities of a Fed hike or Hyperliquid reaching $62. All three AIs also agree on a \"YES\" for Market 2, seeing a positive edge based on historical match data. The primary disagreement is on the magnitude of the edge for Markets 1 and 3, with AI #2 and #3 assigning much lower true probabilities than AI #1.",
