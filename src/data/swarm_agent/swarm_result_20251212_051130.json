President Donald Trump announced the operation, describing the vessel as the largest ever seized and suggesting the U.S. would retain the oil aboard.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The news shows only limited U.S. actions (tanker seizure, carrier deployment) focused on drug trafficking rather than regime change operations. A full military engagement sufficient to topple Maduro's entrenched regime is unlikely, and history shows such regimes often survive limited engagements.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite defections and declining national favorability, Poilievre retains 78% support among Conservative voters ahead of his January 2026 leadership review. Party leaders rarely get ousted when they maintain strong base support, even during difficult periods.\n\nMARKET 3: FURIA\nReasoning: FURIA has dominated recent head-to-head matchups against NAVI, including a 1-0 win on December 4, 2025, and a reverse sweep victory at the Thunderpick World Championship. Their current form strongly favors them in Map 1.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The news indicates escalating US military tensions and increased presence in the Caribbean, including the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker, suggesting a real potential for engagement. Given the overwhelming US military power, it is highly improbable that Maduro's regime would survive a direct US military engagement.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Pierre Poilievre faces significant challenges, including two recent MP defections weakening his party's position and a mandatory leadership review in January 2026, despite retaining strong support among Conservative voters. These factors create substantial pressure and a clear mechanism for him to be ousted before 2027.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: FURIA has a strong recent record against Natus Vincere, having defeated them in their most recent encounter on December 4, 2025, and executing a reverse sweep in the Thunderpick World Championship grand final in October 2025, indicating superior current form and momentum.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While U.S.-Venezuela tensions are escalating with tanker seizures and military presence, the market asks specifically about \"surviving a US military engagement\" - a full military engagement hasn't occurred yet and remains uncertain. The recent $979 trade on No suggests others also see regime survival as likely even if conflict occurs.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite recent MP defections, Poilievre retains 78% favorable rating among Conservative voters and faces only a mandatory leadership review in January 2026. With strong base support and no immediate leadership crisis, he's likely to remain leader through 2026, making departure before 2027 unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: FURIA\nReasoning: FURIA has dominated recent head-to-head matchups against NAVI, including a 1-0 victory on December 4th and a remarkable reverse sweep in October. Their recent form and psychological edge from consecutive victories make them the stronger pick for Map 1.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite the increase in U.S. military presence and the seizure of the oil tanker, there is no explicit indication that the U.S. intends to engage in a full-scale military conflict with Venezuela. The U.S. actions appear to be more aligned with economic and strategic pressure rather than outright military engagement. Thus, the likelihood of Maduro's regime collapsing due to a U.S. military engagement seems low at this point.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While there are challenges facing Poilievre, including defections and a looming leadership review, he still maintains strong support among Conservative voters. The information suggests volatility, but without clear evidence of an imminent leadership change, it's prudent to avoid taking a position until more concrete developments occur.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: FURIA has demonstrated recent dominance over Natus Vincere in their past encounters, including a recent victory at the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025. Given this track record and their current form, betting on FURIA to win Map 1 against NAVI is a favorable decision.",
