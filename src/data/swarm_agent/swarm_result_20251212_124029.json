Facing Real Sociedad away, who are also struggling but traditionally strong at home, makes a win for Girona unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: xAI's Grok 4.1 is up against strong competition from OpenAI's recently launched GPT-5.2 and Google's Gemini 3, both of which have shown superior performance and innovation. This makes it unlikely that xAI will have the top AI model by the end of the year.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: MOUZ is in strong form with recent victories, including a championship win at PGL Wallachia Season 6, while Virtus.pro has been struggling, having won only 1 of their last 5 matches.
