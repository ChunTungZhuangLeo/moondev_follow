  "consensus_summary": "The AI models consistently agree that Market 1 offers a positive edge for North Carolina A&T, but they disagree on its size, leading to a split between \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations due to the 10% threshold.

Regarding Market 3, all models that provided an analysis concur the edge is below 10%, resulting in a unanimous \"NO_TRADE\" consensus.",

Home court advantage and road struggles strongly favor NC A&T, but edge is below threshold.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Israel strike 1 country in December 2025?**\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 55.8%\nEdge: +22.2%\nExpected Value: ~22.2% \u00d7 0.79 = 17.5%\nReasoning: The market asks if Israel will strike \"1 country\" - given Israel's ongoing operations in Gaza (Palestine/Hamas targets), Lebanon (Hezbollah), and Syria (regular airstrikes on Iranian assets), it's nearly certain they've already struck at least one country this month. The question wording suggests this is asking about minimum 1 strike, which is extremely likely given ongoing regional tensions.\n\n**Decision: YES**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: LoL: Dplus KIA vs T1 (BO5)**\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 80.0%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: T1 beat Dplus KIA 3-1 in their most recent playoff series and is historically the stronger team with Faker. However, DK did beat T1 2-1 in LCK Cup 2025, showing they can compete. The 80% price for T1 seems slightly high but within reasonable range.

MDES is 1-8 on the road with a three-game losing streak.

With 18+ days remaining in December and established patterns of cross-border strikes, the probability of at least one strike is significantly higher than market pricing suggests.
