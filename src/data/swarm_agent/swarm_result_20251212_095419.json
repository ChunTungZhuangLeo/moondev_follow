However, the market already prices MOUZ at ~58%, which aligns closely with my estimate. Both teams have 50% win rates on Ancient historically, making this a coin-flip adjusted for recent form.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump pardon Maduro by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 99.5%\nMarket Price: 97.8% (for NO)\nEdge: +1.7%\nExpected Value: Too small to trade meaningfully\nReasoning: Wait - this market is priced at 97.8% for what exactly?

However, \"Map 1\" specifically is harder to predict - could be FaZe's pick where they're stronger. The 5.8% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a confident trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Will Trump pardon Maduro by December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 1%\nMarket Price: 97.8% (NO is priced at 97.8%)\nEdge: -96.8% (This is a NO bet - market severely overprices NO)\nExpected Value: Extremely High (96.8% \u00d7 payout on YES)\nReasoning: This market appears INVERTED - the 97.8% price should be on NO, not YES. Trump isn't even president until Jan 20, 2026, and can't pardon a foreign leader. U.S. just sanctioned Maduro's family on Dec 11. The probability of this happening is <1%. **BET YES if that's the underpriced side, or clarify market structure.**\n\n**CRITICAL NOTE:** If 97.8% represents the NO price, then YES is at 2.2% - which is CORRECT and offers no edge.

If it's already #1, it cannot be #2. This is a clear NO bet with massive edge - the market has severely mispriced this obvious outcome.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: Strong NO bet - market participants may not have read that it's currently #1, not #2.**",
