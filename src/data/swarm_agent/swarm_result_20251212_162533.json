  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on the Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire market, as all AIs agree the high market price is unjustified given recent clashes and political turmoil. For the Dota 2 markets, opinions are mixed with no clear trade recommendation, as analysts disagree on interpreting past match data versus current odds. Overall, the ceasefire market presents the only unified, high-conviction opportunity based on a significant perceived edge.",

      "response": "Here are my analyses for each market:\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 37.0%\nEdge: -18% (betting NO on PARIVISION, meaning YES on Team Falcons)\nExpected Value: 18% \u00d7 1.59 = ~28.6%\nReasoning: The search results show this match already occurred on August 23, 2025, where PARIVISION won Game 1 (9-9 score listed, likely a typo but confirmed PARIVISION victory). However, the market date suggests December 12, 2025 - this appears to be a different upcoming match. Given Team Falcons' strong recent form (winning the series 2-1) and competitive history, I estimate Falcons have ~55% chance, making PARIVISION at 37% slightly overpriced. Betting NO (Falcons).\n\n**MARKET 2: NO**\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 96.6%\nEdge: -61.6%\nExpected Value: 61.6% \u00d7 ~29 = very high\nReasoning: With only 3 days until December 15 deadline, no ceasefire exists. Active border clashes occurred December 7, Thailand dissolved parliament December 11 creating political chaos, and both sides blame each other for attacks. A ceasefire in 72 hours during this turmoil is extremely unlikely. Market is massively overpriced.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 90.0% (for GamerLegion)\nEdge: -75% (but this seems wrong)\nReasoning: The context shows 1win is favored by betting odds (1.43 coefficient = ~70% implied), and 1win has won 5/8 recent matches vs GamerLegion's 2/8. The market showing 90% for GamerLegion contradicts all available information. This is likely a data error or the market is for 1win. Given uncertainty about what the market is actually pricing, NO_TRADE is safest.",

      "response": "# Polymarket Predictions Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 37.0%\nEdge: -2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: The web context describes a PAST match from August 2025, not the current December 12, 2025 match. PARIVISION won Game 1 historically but lost the series 2-1. Without current form data for this specific December match, and with only -2% edge, there's insufficient value. Historical head-to-head shows competitive matchup (PARIVISION 3-2 in last 5 before August).\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 96.6%\nEdge: -21.6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: As of December 12, there is NO ceasefire agreement with only 3 days until deadline. Active border clashes occurred December 7 with both sides blaming each other. Thailand's PM just dissolved parliament December 11, creating political instability that makes diplomatic agreements extremely unlikely in 72 hours. Market is severely overpricing YES at 96.6%.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 90.0%\nEdge: -5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Match scheduled for 14:30 UTC December 12 (hasn't occurred yet). GamerLegion's recent form is poor (2-8 in last matches) while 1win shows stronger consistency (5-8). Betting odds favor 1win at 1.43. However, 90% market price already reflects GamerLegion's weakness, leaving only 5% edge - below the 10% threshold for trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 2 - BET NO**\n\nThe Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire market shows the clearest mispricing with -21.6% edge. Active military conflict, political dissolution of Thai parliament, and only 3 days remaining make a ceasefire extremely improbable despite the 96.6% YES price.",
