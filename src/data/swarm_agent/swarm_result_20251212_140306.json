The December 1st defensive battle (99-98) significantly lowers the average. With mixed signals and the line set appropriately at 233.5, there's minimal edge despite scoring averages suggesting slight over tendency.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Counter-Strike: BIG vs Sangal (BO3)**\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 48%\nEdge: +4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal positive\nReasoning: BIG ranks higher (#53 vs #59) and both teams have identical 3-2 recent form. With no head-to-head history and minimal ranking separation, BIG has a slight edge but not enough to justify a trade. The 48% market price on BIG is fairly efficient given the close matchup.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Will Israel strike Lebanon on December 13?**\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 79.3%\nEdge: +12.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive (~12.7% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Israel conducted multiple airstrikes on December 12 targeting Hezbollah facilities, establishing a clear pattern of daily strikes. Given the ongoing military operations, UNIFIL violations reports, and active conflict posture, the probability of strikes continuing on December 13 is extremely high.

The 232-point game nearly hit the over, and with both teams' offensive capabilities, the over has reasonable value - but not enough edge to recommend a trade.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Counter-Strike: BIG vs Sangal (BO3)**\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 48%\nEdge: +10%\nExpected Value: 10% \u00d7 2.08 = ~0.21 units per unit wagered\nReasoning: BIG is ranked higher (53rd vs 59th), and historically German tier-2 organizations like BIG have deeper talent pools and infrastructure. In BO3 format, the slightly better team tends to prevail more consistently. Both have identical recent form (3-2), but BIG's organizational pedigree gives them an edge.\n\nDecision: YES\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Israel strike Lebanon on December 13?**\nYour Probability: 88%\nMarket Price: 79.3%\nEdge: +8.7%\nExpected Value: Not quite 10% threshold\nReasoning: Israel conducted strikes on December 12 and has been consistently violating the ceasefire according to UNIFIL. The pattern of daily strikes makes December 13 highly likely to see continued military action. However, the edge falls just short of the 10% threshold, and the recent $1,000 NO trade suggests some informed money thinks differently.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- Market 1: NO_TRADE (6% edge insufficient)\n- Market 2: **YES on BIG** (10% edge, organizational advantage)\n- Market 3: NO_TRADE (8.7% edge, just below threshold)",
