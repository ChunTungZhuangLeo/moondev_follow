However, he has expressed openness to the possibility. In a May 2025 interview, Beshear stated he \"would consider\" running for president in 2028, emphasizing his desire to unify the country and leave a better future for the next generation.

In December 2024, he was selected to chair the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2026 midterm elections, a role that involves leading efforts to win governorships in 36 states, including key battlegrounds.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no 10%+ edge trades, with all models agreeing Market 1 is a near toss-up and recommending no trade. Models strongly agree Markets 2 and 3 are significantly overpriced, recommending \"NO\" bets, though they slightly vary on the exact true probability estimates. The collective view is that the current market prices for the political events are excessively high compared to the assessed low likelihoods.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 55.0%\nEdge: -7% (48% - 55%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Prairie View A&M (4-5) is playing away against South Dakota (5-6) who has a strong 4-2 home record. While PVAM had a dominant win against a weak opponent (Champion Christian), South Dakota's home court advantage and similar overall record suggests this is closer to a coin flip. The 55% for South Dakota seems reasonable given home court.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 98%\nMarket Price: 88.2%\nEdge: +9.8% (betting NO means market overvalues YES)\nExpected Value: ~9.8% \u00d7 0.88 = 8.6%\nReasoning: The underlying probability of US-Venezuela military engagement is only ~2.5% per the search context. The question asks if odds will be \"over 20%\" on Friday - with current odds at 2.5% and only diplomatic disputes (not military escalation), it's extremely unlikely odds spike to 20%+ by Friday.

He hasn't even announced, the primary is 3 years away, and historically Democratic primaries are competitive with many viable candidates (Newsom, Whitmer, Shapiro, etc.). Even frontrunners rarely have 97%+ odds this far out. This appears to be a massive mispricing - NO at 2.3% offers exceptional value.",

While PVAM had a blowout win against Champion Christian (a weak opponent), South Dakota's 5-6 record and home advantage makes this essentially a coin flip. Market price of 45% for PVAM (implied) seems roughly fair. Insufficient edge for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 5%\n**Market Price:** 88.2%\n**Edge:** -83.2% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive on NO side\n**Reasoning:** This market asks if Polymarket odds will show >20% probability of US-Venezuela military engagement by Dec 31 ON FRIDAY (Dec 13). Current odds are only ~2.5%, and there's no credible path to jump to 20%+ in one day. Recent disputes over migrant flights and oil tanker seizures are routine diplomatic tensions, not precursors to imminent military action. The market is severely overpricing YES at 88.2% when the actual probability is near 5%.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Strong BET NO - This is a massive mispricing with 83%+ edge on the NO side.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Your Probability:** 8%\n**Market Price:** 97.7%\n**Edge:** -89.7% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Extremely strong positive on NO side\n**Reasoning:** The market is pricing Beshear at 97.7% to WIN the 2028 nomination - this is absurdly high for someone who hasn't even declared candidacy. While he's positioning himself (DGA chair, expressing openness), the 2028 field will be crowded with Newsom, Whitmer, Shapiro, and others. Even strong candidates rarely exceed 30-40% probability this far out. Historical base rates show governors from red states rarely win Democratic nominations.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Extremely Strong BET NO - This appears to be a catastrophic mispricing, likely due to market confusion or liquidity issues. A 97.7% probability for any non-incumbent candidate 3+ years before the election is irrational.",
