A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from December 3 to 8, 2025, reported his approval rating at 41%, up from 38% in late November. This uptick is attributed to growing Republican support for his focus on cost-of-living issues, such as scaling back tariffs and addressing high food prices. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-approval-rating-rises-republicans-back-cost-of-living-efforts-2025-12-09/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, other polls present a more critical view. A Gallup poll released on December 9, 2025, indicates a decline in Trump's approval rating to 36%, nearing his all-time low. This drop is observed across all political groups, including Republicans, and is linked to unpopular policies like aggressive deportation campaigns and tariff implementations.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/germany-qualify-2026-world-cup-with-6-0-demolition-slovakia-2025-11-17/?utm_source=openai)) This win concluded a qualifying campaign that included a historic 2-0 away defeat to Slovakia in September 2025, marking Germany's first-ever away loss in World Cup qualification.

For Market 3, the consensus leans heavily toward \"NO\" or \"NO_TRADE,\" citing Germany's inconsistency and the high uncertainty of predicting a World Cup winner this far in advance.",

FCSB scored only three goals and conceded eight in their last five matches, while Feyenoord scored four and conceded nine. This suggests potential for both low and high-scoring games, making the over/under 2.5 goal line difficult to predict with confidence.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite some fluctuations, Trump's approval rating was reported at 41% in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, showing an increase from previous months. Given the proximity to the 40% threshold and the recent positive shift, betting on Trump's approval rating not hitting 40% seems less favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Germany has shown strong performance in their recent qualifying matches, indicating a potential for success in the World Cup. However, given the competitive nature of the tournament and the fact that the event is still months away, predicting a win for Germany at this stage carries significant uncertainty, warranting a cautious approach.",
