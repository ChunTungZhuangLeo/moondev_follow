The most recent significant military action occurred on March 18, 2025, when Israel launched surprise airstrikes on Gaza, effectively ending the January 2025 ceasefire. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip?utm_source=openai))\n\nSince then, efforts have been focused on stabilization and reconstruction. The United States is preparing to deploy an International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza as early as January 2026, aiming to support demilitarization and stabilize the region. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-aims-international-gaza-force-deployment-early-next-year-say-us-officials-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, an international conference is scheduled in Doha on December 16, 2025, to plan the establishment of this force.

In October 2025, during an interview with the BBC, Harris stated, \"I am not done,\" indicating openness to a potential run. ([opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/25/kamala-harris-leaves-door-open-president/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn July 2025, Harris announced she would not seek the governorship of California, opting instead to focus on national political engagement. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_United_States_presidential_election?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent polling data presents a mixed picture regarding Harris's prospects:\n\n- **Democratic Primary Polls**: A November 2025 poll by RacetotheWH showed Harris's support declining from 35.1% in March to 21.1% in August, with California Governor Gavin Newsom leading at 24%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for both the Israel-Gaza strike and the Montpellier match, citing explicit news of no strike plans and Grenoble's superior home form. For the 2028 election, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" reflecting agreement on Harris's uncertain candidacy and mixed polls but disagreement on whether that warrants a prediction. Overall, the analysis is unified on two markets and cautiously divided on the third due to its long-term speculative nature.",

Additionally, an international conference is approaching to discuss further support for the region.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Kamala Harris has not declared her candidacy for the 2028 U.S. presidential election, and while she has indicated openness to running, her current polling suggests mixed support. Without a declared candidacy or clearer indications of her political trajectory, it's premature to make a definitive prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite recent mixed results from Montpellier HSC, Grenoble Foot 38 has been in strong form, especially at home, winning four of their last five matches. This suggests a higher likelihood of Grenoble performing well in their upcoming match against Montpellier.",
