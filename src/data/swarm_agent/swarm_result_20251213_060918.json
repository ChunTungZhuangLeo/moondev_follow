  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for Market 3 (Over 2.5 goals) due to a clear mismatch, while all analysts agree Market 1 (Valencia win) is severely mispriced, recommending a \"NO\" bet. There is minor disagreement on the exact edge for Market 2, but all conclude it offers no actionable trade as the market price accurately reflects Mendoza's high Heisman probability. Overall, the collective analysis recommends trading against Valencia's inflated odds and taking the over in the Arsenal match.",
