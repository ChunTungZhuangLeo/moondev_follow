Market 3 is generally seen as a \"No Trade\" with minimal edge, as the models lack a strong, unified conviction on the outcome.",

The web search context appears to be hallucinated or misdated. The Steam Awards 2025 won't occur until late 2025/early 2026, and an unreleased game cannot win. The market is severely mispriced at 81.3% for an impossible outcome, but this appears to be a data quality issue requiring clarification before trading.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Market appears broken/needs investigation)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13% edge on Under)\nReasoning: Both teams show strong defensive trends (under hit in 2 straight for Pacers, 4 straight for 76ers). Both rank top-7 in defensive rating recently while ranking mid-pack or worse offensively. The line at 225.5 is actually LOWER than the 226.5 mentioned in context, making Under even more attractive. Recent scoring averages (114.5 and 114.8) suggest total around 229, but defensive improvements and under trends support staying below 225.5.\n\n**Decision: YES (bet UNDER)**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 54.0%\nEdge: -4.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal negative\nReasoning: Islanders just shut out Lightning 2-0 on Dec 6 with dominant goaltending from Sorokin. However, Islanders have key injury to Bo Horvat (lower body), and this is a back-to-back situation after their Dec 11 game vs Ducks. Lightning at home historically competitive.
