Both teams are struggling, with the Bulls on a seven-game losing streak and the Hornets having lost three of their last four games.

In their most recent game, they suffered a 123-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors, marking their worst offensive performance of the season. Josh Giddey has been a standout, averaging 20.3 points and leading the team in five of the last six games.

([kabutoking.online](https://kabutoking.online/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis surge has been accompanied by notable events, including a charity auction where a signed first-edition Kabuto card sold for $51,100, with proceeds benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-auction-autographed-card-154500572.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven this rapid appreciation, it's plausible that the first-edition Kabuto card could reach or exceed $100 by December 31, 2025, especially if the collector continues to acquire more cards, further limiting supply. \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not yet held its January 2026 meeting, so no official decision has been made regarding a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut. However, recent developments provide insight into potential future actions:\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut**: The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75% in its December 2025 meeting. This decision was accompanied by projections indicating only one more 25 bps cut in 2026, suggesting a cautious approach to further rate reductions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/brokerages-stick-with-us-rate-cut-forecasts-despite-fed-caution-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Market Expectations**: Despite the Fed's cautious stance, several major financial institutions maintain forecasts for additional rate cuts in 2026. Goldman Sachs anticipates that the Fed will pause its cutting cycle in January before implementing cuts in March and June, aiming to bring the funds rate\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a potential 10%+ edge only for Market 2, though analysts are split on direction, with some strongly recommending YES and others NO. For Market 1, most agree it's a near coin-flip with no clear 10% edge, and for Market 3, the group largely views the market price as accurate or overconfident, also offering no high-conviction trade. Overall, the collective analysis suggests cautious trading, with significant disagreement on the Kabuto card being the sole notable opportunity.",

Road games are typically harder, but the Hornets' injury situation is severe. This is essentially a coin flip between two bad teams, with slight edge to Bulls due to opponent injuries.

The \"Kabuto King\" manipulation could continue but such rapid appreciation typically faces resistance as price targets become widely known. The charity auction of a SIGNED card at $51K doesn't indicate regular card prices will hit $100.

Josh Giddey has been performing well. The Hornets' injury situation is more critical than the Bulls' form slump, giving Chicago a slight edge. However, the 7% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?\n**Your Probability: 25%**\n**Market Price: 40%**\n**Edge: -15%**\n**Expected Value: +15% on NO side**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** While \"Kabuto King\" has driven prices from $1 to $37, reaching $100 (a 170% increase from current ~$37) in just 19 days is extremely unlikely. The charity auction's $51,100 was for a signed/special edition card, not regular first editions. The market is overpricing this possibility - the momentum would need to accelerate dramatically beyond what's realistic in the collectibles market.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\n**Your Probability: 15%**\n**Market Price: 81%**\n**Edge: -66%**\n**Expected Value: +66% on NO side**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** The Fed just cut rates in December 2025 and explicitly projected only ONE more 25 bps cut for ALL of 2026, signaling a pause. Goldman Sachs specifically forecasts the Fed will PAUSE in January before potentially cutting in March/June. An 81% probability of a January cut directly contradicts the Fed's guidance and expert forecasts. This market is severely mispriced - massive edge on NO.",
