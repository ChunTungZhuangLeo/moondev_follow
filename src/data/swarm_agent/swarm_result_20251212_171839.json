Market 2 shows the most disagreement, ranging from a strong \"NO\" to \"NO_TRADE,\" though all agree the 96% price is likely too high.",

The 60% market price significantly overvalues West Brom's chances at home.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -4%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Trump announced plans to name Board of Peace members \"early next year\" (2025), but the actual establishment appears to be planned for 2025. However, the announcement says he'll name members \"early next year\" which could mean 2026, creating some uncertainty about whether formal establishment happens in 2025.
