([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/lighter-market-cap-fdv-10b-one-day-after-launch-978-517?utm_source=openai)) This suggests that the majority of market participants anticipate a valuation below $8 billion at launch.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Funding and Valuation:** In November 2025, Lighter, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 decentralized exchange specializing in perpetual futures, secured $68 million in funding led by Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. This investment valued the company at $1.5 billion prior to its Token Generation Event (TGE). ([todayonchain.com](https://www.todayonchain.com/news/article/01K9SN9EQMQXSDBYJ7HVDF2CKE/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Market Performance:** Lighter has demonstrated strong performance, recording a 24-hour trading volume of over $110 bi...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Nothing Ever Happens: AI Edition\nRecent trade: $837.47 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/nothing-ever-happens-ai-edition\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe \"Nothing Ever Happens: AI Edition\" is a prediction market on Polymarket, established on September 19, 2025, with a volume of $91,142. The market is set to resolve to \"No\" if any of the following occur between September 19, 2025, and December 31, 2025:\n\n- Artificial Intelligence is named TIME's Person of 2025\n- GPT-5 scores above 40% on Humanity\u2019s Last Exam\n- AI wins the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medal\n- An AI model scores \u2265 90% on the FrontierMath Benchmark\n- AI scores \u2265 85% on the ARC-AGI-2\n\nIf none of these events occur by December 31, 2025, the market will resolve to \"Yes.\" If resolution-relevant information is unavailable by December 31, 2025, the market may remain open until January 31, 2026. If by that date there is still no clear information indicating that one of the listed events has occurred, the market will resolve to \"Yes.\" ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/nothing-ever-happens-ai-edition?utm_source=openai))\n\nAs of December 12, 2025, th...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$10B one day after launch?\nRecent trade: $575.91 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/lighter-market-cap-fdv-one-day-after-launch\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAchieving a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion within a single day post-launch is an extraordinary feat in the cryptocurrency sector. Historically, only a few digital assets have accomplished this rapid ascent.\n\n**Notable Examples:**\n\n- **$TRUMP Token:** Launched in January 2025, the $TRUMP cryptocurrency experienced a meteoric rise, reaching a market capitalization of approximately $11.7 billion within a day. This surge was driven by its association with then-President Donald Trump and significant media attention. ([kathmandupost.com](https://kathmandupost.com/world/2025/01/20/trump-s-crypto-token-surges-to-11-7-billion-market-cap-bitcoin-hits-record-high?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Axie Infinity (AXS):** In August 2025, Axie Infinity's governance token, AXS, achieved a market capitalization of $10 million immediately after its launch. This rapid growth was attributed to its innovative play-to-earn model and the popularity of its digital pet ecosystem.

Without concrete data, taking a position would be speculative.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Achieving a market cap over $10 billion in one day is historically rare and usually requires significant media attention or unique circumstances, neither of which are currently associated with Lighter.

These are extremely high bars that haven't been met yet.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: A >$10B FDV would require nearly 7x the $1.5B pre-launch valuation, which is exceptionally rare even in crypto.

TIME's Person of the Year is typically announced in early December (likely already determined), and the technical benchmarks require significant advances unlikely in this timeframe.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: If the market assigns only 2.1% probability to >$8B FDV, the probability of >$10B is even lower.
