In their previous game, Embiid struggled with shooting, making only 4 of 21 attempts, while George added 12 points in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite these challenges, George emphasizes the importance of continued practice and shared court time to build rhythm.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1 is severely mispriced due to a likely non-existent event, though analysts disagree on whether to trade or avoid it due to resolution risks. For Markets 2 and 3, opinions are split on the direction and size of the edge, with no clear 10%+ trade opportunity emerging consistently across the models. Overall, the only actionable insight is the high confidence that the Trump market price is wrong, but the recommended action varies.",

C\u00e1diz's recent collapse from 2-0 to lose 2-3 raises concerns.

While the 76ers have struggled, games involving Indiana typically trend toward higher scoring. Embiid's presence increases pace and scoring opportunities. The 46% price on Over seems undervalued given the Pacers' offensive style and both teams' defensive vulnerabilities.",
