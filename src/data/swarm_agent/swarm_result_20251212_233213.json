For the NBA over/under (Market 1), opinions are split between a definitive \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" though all agree the statistical context favors the under. Regarding the Gensyn sale (Market 3), the consensus is that the market price is overly optimistic, but the edge calculation varies, leading to mixed trade recommendations.",

While Oxford has struggled (1 win in 5), traditional betting odds show Oxford favored at 2.55-2.80, implying Preston win probability around 28-33%.

Both teams rank 6th/7th in defensive rating over last 10 games while offensive ratings lag (17th/25th). However, market at 48% already reflects this, leaving insufficient edge.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Only 3% edge insufficient for recommended trade threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Will Preston North End FC win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 34.9%\nEdge: +13.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13.1% \u00d7 ~2.86 payout = +37% EV)\nReasoning: Oxford United has won only 1 of last 5 games showing poor form. Preston drew 1-1 with mid-table Coventry away, suggesting competitiveness. Market significantly undervalues Preston at 34.9% when traditional odds (2.55-2.80 for Oxford) imply closer to 40-45% for Preston win in what should be relatively even match.\n\n**Decision: YES** - 13.1% edge exceeds threshold, Oxford's poor form not fully priced in.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Over $400M committed to the Gensyn public sale?**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 83.2%\nEdge: -28.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side (-28.2% \u00d7 ~6 payout = +169% EV on NO)\nReasoning: Only 300M tokens (3% supply) available with FDV range $100M-$1B. At $1B FDV, 300M tokens = $30M maximum raise, not $400M. Even at highest valuation, the math doesn't support $400M commitments unless there's massive oversubscription that gets scaled back. Market severely overestimates probability at 83.2%.\n\n**Decision: NO** - 28.2% edge on NO side, market has fundamental misunderstanding of token sale mechanics.",
