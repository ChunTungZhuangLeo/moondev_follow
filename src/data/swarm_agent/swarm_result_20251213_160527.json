  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees on \"NO\" for Royval winning by KO/TKO due to his low knockout rate, and \"YES\" for the soccer match going over 3.5 goals based on PSG's offense and Metz's defense. The only notable disagreement is on the Kanye market, where two AIs predict \"NO\" while one advises \"NO_TRADE\" due to its speculative nature. Overall, the predictions align with the provided statistics and recent market trades.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Brandon Royval has a relatively low knockout rate (24% of his wins by KO) and his recent performance includes a loss by unanimous decision. Given these factors, along with significant recent trading on \"No,\" it seems unlikely he will win by KO or TKO against a tough opponent like Manel Kape.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: There is no confirmed information suggesting Kanye West plans to visit Israel by December 31, 2025. The current market prediction of a 2% chance and the lack of any announcements or travel plans make it improbable that he will visit within the specified timeframe.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: PSG's strong offensive performance, averaging 2.2 goals per game, combined with FC Metz's poor defensive record, conceding an average of 2.1 goals per match, suggests a high-scoring game is likely. Betting on the \"Over\" 3.5 goals market aligns with these trends and recent market activity.",
