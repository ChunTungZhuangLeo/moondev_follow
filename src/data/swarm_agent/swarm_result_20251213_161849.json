Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has consistently stated that it will not establish diplomatic ties with Israel unless Israel first recognizes an independent and sovereign Palestinian state. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang reiterated this position on September 30, 2025, emphasizing that any vision regarding Israel must begin with recognition of Palestine\u2019s independence.

Recent releases of Epstein-related documents, including flight logs and visitor records, have not identified Obama as a visitor to Epstein's properties or as a passenger on his planes. Fact-checking organizations have consistently debunked claims suggesting such connections, emphasizing that these lists are fabricated and do not match official records. ([binghamtonherald.com](https://binghamtonherald.com/fact-check-no-official-public-epstein-documents-dont-name-joe-biden-and-barack-obama/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump on November 19, 2025, mandates the release of all unclassified documents related to Epstein by December 19, 2025. While this legislation aims to provide transparency, it is unlikely to reveal any new information implicating Obama, as previous investigations have found no evidence \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Burnley FC win on 2025-12-13?\nCurrent Market Price: 76.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,098.18 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/epl-bur-ful-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nBurnley FC is set to face Fulham FC on Saturday, December 13, 2025, at Turf Moor. \n\n**Recent Form:**\n\n- **Burnley FC:** Burnley has been struggling, losing their last five Premier League matches.

  "consensus_summary": "All three AI models agree the market price for Israel-Indonesia normalization is vastly overconfident, recommending a \"NO\" trade with a significant perceived edge. There is unanimous consensus that Barack Obama is unlikely to be named in Epstein files, though one model abstains from a trade due to headline risk. For the Burnley match, all models also agree the market overvalues a win, favoring a \"NO\" bet based on the team's poor form.",
