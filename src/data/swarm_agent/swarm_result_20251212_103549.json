  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 (Pau FC) presents a clear buy opportunity with a significant positive edge, while Market 1 (49ers spread) is generally seen as fairly priced with no actionable edge. There is sharp disagreement on Market 3 (Xi Jinping), with estimates ranging from 10% to 97% true probability, indicating extreme uncertainty and making any trade recommendation unreliable. Overall, only Market 2 consistently meets the 10%+ edge threshold for a recommended trade.",

Injuries to key players and the unpredictability of NFL games make this essentially a coin flip. The market is fairly priced for a large spread like this.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Pau FC win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 65%\nEdge: -7%\nExpected Value: -7% \u00d7 ~0.54 = -3.8%\nReasoning: While Pau FC is in decent form with a recent 1-0 win and Amiens has lost 5 straight, home wins in Ligue 2 are never as certain as odds suggest. Bookmaker odds of 1.44-1.60 imply roughly 62-69% probability, aligning with market.

The market price of 47% for covering -13.5 seems reasonable given NFL spread volatility. Insufficient edge to justify a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Your Probability:** 78%\n**Market Price:** 65%\n**Edge:** +13% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive (+13% \u00d7 ~0.54 payout = ~7% EV)\n**Reasoning:** Pau FC just beat Montpellier 1-0 and are at home, while Amiens has lost 5 consecutive Ligue 2 matches. Betting odds of 1.44-1.60 for Pau win translate to ~62-69% implied probability, suggesting the 65% market price undervalues Pau's chances given their superior form and home advantage.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Your Probability:** 5%\n**Market Price:** 89% (NO side)\n**Edge:** -84% (This means YES side has +84% edge, so bet NO)\n**Expected Value:** Massive - NO side severely underpriced\n**Reasoning:** The market shows 89% probability that Xi will NOT leave before 2027, but this appears to be an error in how the price is displayed. Xi Jinping consolidated power, eliminated term limits in 2018, and there's no credible evidence of imminent departure. The true probability he stays in power through 2027 is ~95%+. If 89% is the NO price (he stays), that's actually undervalued - should be 95%+, giving +6% edge on NO.\n\n**WAIT - CORRECTION ON MARKET 3:**\nIf the market price of 89% represents the probability of the event NOT happening (Xi staying), and recent trade was $890 on NO, then the YES price is 11%. The true probability of Xi leaving before 2027 is ~5%, so NO at 89% needs to be ~95%. Edge is only +6%, below our 10% threshold.\n\n## MARKET 3 REVISED: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 5% (for Xi leaving)\n**Market Price:** 11% YES / 89% NO\n**Edge:** +6% on NO side (95% true prob - 89% market)\n**Expected Value:** Moderate but below threshold\n**Reasoning:** No credible evidence of Xi departure. Rumors are speculation only. He eliminated term limits and consolidated power. True probability of staying is ~95%, but market NO price of 89% only offers 6% edge - below our 10% minimum threshold.",
