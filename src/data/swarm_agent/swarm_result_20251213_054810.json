  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for Markets 1 and 2, citing a lack of imminent resignation news for Abbas and NVIDIA's current price being above the target range. For Market 3, there is a clear disagreement, with a split between models predicting \"Under\" and \"Over\" 1.5 goals based on differing interpretations of team form and defensive vulnerabilities. Overall, the predictions for Markets 1 and 2 show high agreement, while Market 3 lacks a unified forecast.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: There is no official announcement or significant indication that Mahmoud Abbas will resign by December 31, despite the appointment of a potential successor. The recent developments, such as the resignation of the Palestinian Prime Minister, suggest political shifts but do not directly point to Abbas stepping down imminently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: NVIDIA's current trading price is $175.02, which is above the $160\u2013165 range. Analysts have raised their price targets, with one projecting a year-end price significantly higher than the target range. Therefore, it seems unlikely for NVIDIA to close within $160\u2013165 by the end of 2025.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Parma Calcio 1913 has a low goal-scoring average, and their recent matches have resulted in few goals. With Parma's poor offensive record and conceding more goals than scoring, a low-scoring game is plausible, suggesting the match could end with fewer than 1.5 goals.",

With only ~18 days remaining and no concrete resignation news, the status quo is likely to hold.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO**\nReasoning: NVIDIA is currently trading at $175.02, which is above the $160-165 range. With strong analyst targets (some projecting $233) and only ~18 days left in 2025, the stock would need to drop 6-9% to fall into this specific range, which seems unlikely given positive AI chip momentum.\n\n**MARKET 3: YES (Over 1.5 goals)**\nReasoning: Despite Parma's low-scoring tendency (9 goals scored), Lazio under Sarri typically plays attacking football, and Parma has been conceding 2.33 goals per home match recently. The combination of Lazio's offensive capability against a leaky Parma defense suggests over 1.5 goals is likely in this matchup.",
