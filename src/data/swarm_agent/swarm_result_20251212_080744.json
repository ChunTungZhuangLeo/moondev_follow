This win marked their 16th consecutive, tying the best 25-game start in NBA history. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the team with 28 points and eight assists.

He announced plans to begin issuing these dividends by mid-2026, with payments potentially starting as early as next year. ([foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-tariff-funded-dividend-payments-americans-begin-next-year.print?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of this plan. Analysts estimate that such dividends could cost approximately $600 billion annually, while current tariff revenues are projected to be around $200 to $300 billion per year. This shortfall suggests that the proposed dividends may not be sustainable without additional funding sources.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/basketball/cavaliers-use-big-3rd-quarter-overcome-spurs--flm-2025-12-06/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Wizards:** The Wizards have the worst defense and point differential in the NBA and are tied for the fewest wins in the league.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with most models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to the 2026 timeline and funding shortfall creating a massive edge. For Market 1, most analysts see the Thunder as likely favorites but find insufficient edge versus the market price, recommending no trade. On Market 3, opinions are split between a \"YES\" bet citing the Cavaliers' matchup advantage and a \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient edge, indicating higher uncertainty.",

However, the Spurs have also shown capability by defeating strong teams. While the Thunder's form suggests a high probability of winning, the market has largely priced this in, resulting in insufficient edge for a recommended trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 85%  \nMarket Price: 97.5%  \nEdge: -12.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -$12.50 per $100 wagered  \nReasoning: Although President Trump's proposal for a tariff dividend has been announced, significant financial and logistical hurdles exist, including a shortfall in tariff revenue and feasibility concerns raised by experts. The high market probability does not adequately reflect these challenges, suggesting an overvaluation of the \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nYour Probability: 65%  \nMarket Price: 52.0%  \nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +$13 per $100 wagered  \nReasoning: Despite recent struggles, the Cavaliers are facing a Wizards team with the worst defense and a long losing streak against them. The Cavaliers' recent victory over the Spurs, despite losses, and the Wizards' poor performance provide a reasonable expectation that the Cavaliers can cover the spread. The market underestimates this possibility, providing adequate edge for a \"Yes\" bet.",

However, NBA Cup semifinal is single elimination and Spurs have talent with Fox and Castle. The 81% price seems reasonable given Thunder's dominance.\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\nMARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -89.5% (8% - 97.5%)\nExpected Value: Massive edge on NO side\nReasoning: The news explicitly states dividends would begin \"mid-2026\" and \"as early as next year\" (from 2025 perspective), NOT in 2025. The math doesn't work ($600B cost vs $200-300B revenue), and implementing such a program requires congressional action and massive bureaucratic setup.
