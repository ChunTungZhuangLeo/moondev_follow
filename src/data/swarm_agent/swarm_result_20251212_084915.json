The announcement itself likely satisfies \"creating\" a tariff dividend in 2025, though there's minor uncertainty about exact resolution criteria.

The key issue is timing - \"by mid-2026\" suggests implementation won't happen in 2025. However, \"create\" could mean announce rather than distribute, which Trump has already done. The 97.5% price suggests market interprets \"create\" as announce/establish the program, which has occurred. Edge insufficient for trade.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 52.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13% edge on -14.5 spread)\nReasoning: Cavaliers covering -14.5 against the worst defense in the NBA with worst point differential. Despite Cleveland's recent 5-7 stretch, Wizards have lost 13 straight to them dating to 2022 and are tied for fewest wins in league. Historical dominance and massive talent gap favor large margin victory. Market undervaluing Cleveland's ability to cover against league's worst team.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -15.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: 9INE has only 20% win rate in last month entering playoffs with terrible momentum, while SPARTA shows 58% recent win rate and improving form. Despite 9INE's historical 54% overall win rate, recent form heavily favors SPARTA. Market at 67.9% for 9INE dramatically overvalues them given current momentum differential. Bet NO (SPARTA to win).",
