A notable market on Polymarket, titled \"Will Elon Musk post 1400+ tweets in December 2025?\", is currently trading at 51.7% for the \"Yes\" outcome, indicating a near-even split among participants. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2025/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2025-380-399?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent data suggests that Musk's tweeting frequency has increased significantly. Between December 2 and December 9, 2025, he averaged approximately 42 tweets per day, totaling 298 tweets over seven days. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2-december-9/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2-december-9-280-299?utm_source=openai)) Extrapolating this rate over the entire month of December would result in about 1,300 tweets, slightly below the 1,400-tweet threshold.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that prediction markets\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: TikTok sale announced in 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.5% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $7,459.32 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/tiktok-sale-announced-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nIn 2025, TikTok's sale and restructuring have been pivotal in addressing U.S. national security concerns. In April, President Donald Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest its U.S. operations by 75 days, citing progress in negotiations. ([aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/4/trump-again-extends-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-to-avoid-us-ban?utm_source=openai)) By June, the deadline was further extended by another 90 days, with Trump expressing a desire to \"save TikTok\" and acknowledging the need for more time to finalize the deal. ([english.ahram.org.eg](https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/548298.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn September, Trump approved a plan for a consortium of U.S. and global investors to acquire a majority stake in TikTok's U.S. assets, aiming to comply with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), which mandates divestiture or ban of foreign-controlled applications d\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The AI models generally agree that Market 1 offers only a slight statistical edge for \"Over,\" but the consensus is against trading as the calculated advantage falls below the required 10% threshold. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement on the direction, with models split between \"Yes\" and \"No\" based on differing interpretations of Musk's tweet trajectory, preventing a clear consensus. Regarding Market 3, most models view the market price as too high, but they disagree on whether the edge is sufficient to recommend a \"No\" trade, leading to a mixed or \"No Trade\" stance.",

At this pace over 31 days = ~1,302 tweets. However, this appears to be INCREASING trajectory, and he historically tweets more during controversial periods.
