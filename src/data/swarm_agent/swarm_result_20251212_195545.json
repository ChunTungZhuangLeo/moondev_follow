This inaction is expected to lead to significant increases in health insurance premiums for millions of Americans starting January 1, 2026. The Democratic proposal to extend the subsidies for three years was rejected in a 51-48 vote, lacking sufficient Republican support. Similarly, the Republican alternative, which offered a one-time $1,500 payment to individuals below 700% of the federal poverty level, was also voted down. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/republican-controlled-us-congress-poised-allow-obamacare-health-subsidies-expire-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe expiration of these subsidies is projected to more than double the average annual premiums for ACA Marketplace enrollees, increasing from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026. This substantial rise is anticipated to result in approx...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Aztec launch a token by December 31, 2026?\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-aztec-launch-a-token-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAztec Network, a privacy-focused Ethereum Layer 2 solution, has recently made significant strides toward launching its native token, AZTEC. The public sale of AZTEC tokens concluded on December 6, 2025, raising approximately 19,476 ETH (around $61 million) from over 16,700 participants.

([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-launches-continuous-clearing-auctions-token-sales?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe AZTEC token is designed for staking, governance, and potential transaction fees within the network.

In a recent interview, Messi stated, \"I haven't made a decision yet about the World Cup. Match by match, I'll finish the season, then have preseason, and in six months, I'll see how I feel.\" ([goal.com](https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/lionel-messi-argentina-future-open-for-2026-world-cup/blt40e8991c1eb8d290?utm_source=openai))\n\nMessi's Argentina teammate, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, expressed confidence in Messi's potential participation, saying, \"I don't see Leo missing out on the World Cup.\" ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45587896/lionel-messi-unlikely-miss-2026-world-cup-nicolas-otamendi?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, Messi's former teammate Ariel Ortega believes Messi will be present at the 2026 World Cup, noting his current high level of performance and lack of serious injuries.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: The failure to extend the ACA premium tax credits and the political split in Congress suggest low likelihood of extension before the end of 2025. Additionally, with the Republican Party not supporting the extension and given the current Senate composition, it seems unlikely they would win the House in 2026, aligning with the recent \"No\" trades.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Aztec Network has already conducted a successful public sale of its tokens, raising significant funds and involving many participants. This indicates strong momentum and commitment to launching the token before the end of 2026, making a \"Yes\" bet more favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Messi has not committed to playing in the 2026 World Cup, comments from teammates suggest optimism about his participation. However, his personal indecision and the time remaining before the event add uncertainty, making it prudent to avoid taking a definite position at this time.",

Since this is a compound \"AND\" market requiring both credit extension AND Republican House win in 2026, the failure to extend credits means this market resolves NO regardless of the 2026 election outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The news clearly indicates Aztec has already conducted a public token sale that concluded on December 6, 2025, raising ~$61 million for the AZTEC token. With the token sale completed and the token designed for staking/governance, a formal launch by December 31, 2026 is virtually certain.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: While Messi hasn't definitively confirmed participation, his statements indicate he's keeping the door open (\"I'll see how I feel\"), teammates express confidence he'll play, and he's reportedly performing at a high level without serious injuries.
