  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 3 as the clearest opportunity, with all AIs agreeing its ~93% price is a severe overvaluation for an away win between two struggling teams, presenting a strong edge to bet \"NO.\" For Markets 1 and 2, opinions are mixed on direction, but they converge on the conclusion that any perceived edge is below the 10% threshold, making them \"NO_TRADE\" scenarios. Overall, the analysis suggests only Market 3 meets the criteria for a recommended trade.",

This reduces their chances of covering the -1.5 spread against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 90%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +12.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +12.2 \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked significantly higher than Pipsqueak+4 and has strong community support with 97% predicting a victory.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 33%\nEdge: +2%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Blues are dealing with significant injuries (Kyrou, Walker, Snuggerud), but they're still the better team against a weak Blackhawks squad. However, covering -1.5 (winning by 2+) is difficult with these injuries. The market seems fairly priced given the circumstances.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -2.8%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked significantly higher (#9 vs #25) and community sentiment strongly favors them (97%). However, both teams have identical 6-10 recent records, suggesting Pipsqueak+4 may be undervalued. The market at 77.8% seems reasonable - slightly high but not enough edge to bet NO.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8%\nExpected Value: 57.8% \u00d7 (100/92.8 - 1) = ~4.5% return on NO bet\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. Braunschweig is playing AWAY at Dresden, both teams are struggling (14th vs 17th place), and Braunschweig's recent form is poor (1W-1D-3L in last 5). Dresden at home against a struggling opponent should not be 92.8% underdogs. Betting sites typically show this as a close match or slight Dresden favorite. The 92.8% YES price is wildly inconsistent with the actual match dynamics - this is a strong NO.",

However, they're still favored against a weak Blackhawks team. The -1.5 spread is challenging given injuries, but not enough edge to bet NO.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 5%, below our 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Heroic ranked #9 vs #25 Pipsqueak+4, both with 6-4 recent records. 97% community prediction seems excessive. Heroic should win but single game variance in Dota 2 is high, making 78% price reasonable but slightly elevated.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 5.8%, below our 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 38%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -54.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: STRONG POSITIVE on NO side\n\nReasoning: This appears to be SEVERE MISPRICING. Both teams are bottom-table (Dresden 17th, Braunschweig 14th). Braunschweig has 1 win in last 5 matches, Dresden has 2 wins in last 5. This is a toss-up match between struggling teams - nowhere near 93% probability. Market may have confused this with a different match or misread the fixture.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Massive 54.8% edge suggests betting NO (Braunschweig will NOT win). At 92.8% YES price, the NO side offers exceptional value for what should be closer to a 35-40% probability event.",
