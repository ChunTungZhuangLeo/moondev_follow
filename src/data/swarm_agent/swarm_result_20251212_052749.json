Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for greater team effort and attention to detail to break the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets have lost three of their last four games, including a 115-106 defeat to the Denver Nuggets. Coach Charles Lee noted the benefit of rest following a busy stretch of six games in ten days.

([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-looks-corner-market-203000007.html/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis surge in demand has led to notable events, such as a signed Kabuto card auctioned for $51,100, with proceeds benefiting St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-auction-autographed-card-154500572.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven this rapid appreciation, it's plausible that the price of a first-edition Kabuto card could reach $100 by December 31, 2025, especially if the collector continues to acquire more cards, further limiting supply. \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not yet held its January 2026 meeting, so no official decision has been made regarding a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate decrease. However, recent developments provide context for this potential policy action:\n\n**Recent Federal Reserve Actions and Projections:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps, bringing it to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. This marked the third consecutive rate cut, following similar reductions in September and October 2025. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rates-decision?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Future Projections:** The FOMC's projections indicate a cautious approach to future rate cuts. While some market participants anticipate additional cuts in 2026, the Fed's projections suggest only one more 25 bps reduction in 2026, maintaining a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong positive edge for the Kabuto card market, with most models agreeing the \"Yes\" outcome is undervalued. For the Bulls vs. Hornets game, opinions are split between a \"No\" bet and no trade, but all agree the market price overvalues the Bulls. Regarding the Fed decision, models generally see the \"Yes\" outcome as overpriced, but the edge is either negative or insufficient to meet the 10% trade threshold.",

Given the current trajectory and scarcity, it is plausible for the card to reach $100 by the end of the year.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 81.0%\nEdge: -6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -6% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: While the Fed has recently cut rates and there is speculation about additional cuts, the Fed's cautious projections suggest only one more cut in 2026.

Charlotte is at home with rest advantage after a busy stretch. The Hornets' home court advantage and Bulls' severe slump suggests this is closer to a coin flip, making the market overpriced on Chicago.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: -5% \u00d7 2.5 = -12.5% potential return\nReasoning: While the \"Kabuto King\" phenomenon has driven prices from under $1 to ~$37, reaching $100 requires nearly tripling in ~3 weeks. This depends entirely on one collector's continued buying and market manipulation dynamics that are inherently unpredictable. The 40% price seems reasonable given the speculative nature; edge is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -66%\nExpected Value: -66% \u00d7 5.26 = -347% potential return on NO bet\nReasoning: The news states the Fed just cut in December and projects only ONE more 25 bps cut for ALL of 2026, maintaining 3.5%-3.75% range. This strongly suggests a pause in January, not another cut. The market at 81% for a January cut dramatically contradicts the Fed's own forward guidance. This appears to be a significant mispricing.",

Hornets also struggling (3 of last 4 losses) but have home court advantage and Bulls are in freefall. Market overvalues Bulls slightly given their collapse.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\nEdge insufficient (<10% threshold). While Bulls are overvalued, the 6% edge doesn't meet our 10% minimum for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto Card Hits $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability: 65%**\n**Market Price: 40%**\n**Edge: +25%** (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value: Strong positive (+0.25 \u00d7 2.5x payout = +62.5% EV)**\n**Reasoning:** Card already at $37+ from under $1 in 4 months due to \"Kabuto King\" cornering supply (1,800 cards acquired). Signed card hit $51,100. With 19 days left and continued buying pressure limiting supply, $100 is highly achievable - market severely underpricing momentum.\n\n**Decision: YES**\nStrong buy signal. Market hasn't priced in the supply squeeze dynamics and recent price velocity ($1\u2192$37 in months suggests $37\u2192$100 is very feasible in 19 days).\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed 25bps Cut in January 2026\n**Your Probability: 15%**\n**Market Price: 81%**\n**Edge: -66%** (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value: Massive positive on NO side (-0.66 \u00d7 5.26x = -347% EV on YES, inverse for NO)**\n**Reasoning:** Fed just cut December 10th and their own projections show only ONE more 25bps cut total for ALL of 2026, maintaining 3.5-3.75% range. January cut (just 6 weeks later) contradicts their published guidance. Market dramatically overpricing this.\n\n**Decision: NO**\nExtremely strong NO signal. 66% edge is massive - Fed's own projections explicitly indicate cautious approach with minimal 2026 cuts.
