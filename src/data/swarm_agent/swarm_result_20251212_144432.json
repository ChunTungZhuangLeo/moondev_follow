([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** In their most recent game on December 7, 2025, the 76ers faced a 112-108 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.

On Polymarket, a prediction market platform, the \"Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?\" contract is trading at 67% probability, suggesting that traders anticipate no sales this year. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/will-trump-sell-0-gold-cards-in-2025?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, other prediction markets show a high probability of zero sales, with estimates ranging from 67% to 91%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear trade for Market 1, as most AIs see the spread as fairly priced with minimal edge. For Market 2, there is strong agreement that the \"Yes\" (0 sales) contract is overpriced, with most models assigning a lower true probability than the market. Regarding Market 3, opinions are sharply divided, indicating high uncertainty with no reliable edge.",

The 6.5-point spread is fair given recent form. Market pricing appears efficient.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -22.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +22% on NO position\nReasoning: The Gold Card program officially launched December 11, 2025, with 20 days left in the year. At $1M per card targeting wealthy individuals seeking expedited residency, even 1-2 sales before year-end is plausible. Market severely overprices the \"zero sales\" outcome given the program is now active and operational.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -26.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +26% on NO position\nReasoning: Despite U.S. pressure and opposition calls, Maduro has survived numerous regime-change attempts over years. The 3.5-month timeline is extremely aggressive for a dictator with military backing and Russian/Chinese support. Market is overestimating probability of rapid regime change based on recent headlines without accounting for Maduro's historical resilience.",

This is essentially a coin flip spread, and the market is pricing it appropriately.

While $1 million is steep, there are wealthy individuals globally seeking expedited US residency who could act quickly. The program is now LIVE and operational - even one sale resolves this NO. 87% for zero sales seems too high given the program's appeal to ultra-wealthy immigrants and the remaining time. The news confirms the program has officially launched, which changes the calculus significantly.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -36%\nExpected Value: 36% \u00d7 ~1.56 = ~0.56 (betting NO at 39 cents)\nReasoning: Despite US pressure and opposition momentum, authoritarian leaders rarely fall quickly. Maduro has survived multiple crises since 2019, controls the military and state apparatus, and has Russian/Cuban backing. The separate Polymarket showing only 31% chance he even travels outside Venezuela suggests he's firmly entrenched. The 61% probability of removal in ~3.5 months appears significantly overpriced given historical precedent of regime persistence.",
