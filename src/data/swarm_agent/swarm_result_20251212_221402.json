([yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/stranger-things-season-5-makes-025107252.html?utm_source=openai)) Despite a 60% drop in viewership during the second week, from 59.6 million to 23.6 million views, this decline is not uncommon for binge-worthy series, as many viewers tend to watch episodes rapidly upon release.

By December 16 (three weeks post-premiere), viewership will have declined further before Volume 2 releases December 25. Market is slightly overpriced but not enough edge to bet NO.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 73%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +11.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+11% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Leverkusen plays at home (BayArena) against 1. FC K\u00f6ln, a weaker opponent. Despite recent loss to Augsburg, Leverkusen is the superior team. Home advantage in a derby match plus quality gap makes 73% win probability reasonable. Market undervalues home favorite by 11%.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (on Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 82%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: +8.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has superior form (9-5 vs 5-9 record) and ranks 3rd vs Partizan's 16th place. However, this is a heated Belgrade derby with home court advantage for Partizan, which typically creates volatility. Edge is close but falls short of 10% threshold.\n\n**REVISED: NO_TRADE** - Edge of 8% doesn't meet the 10% minimum requirement for recommendation despite favorable matchup dynamics.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -3.8%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Stranger Things 5 broke Netflix records and despite a 60% viewership drop in week 2 (normal for binge shows), it should still dominate the charts heading into Volume 2 release on Dec 25. However, with nearly 3 weeks since premiere, there's slight risk of a new release overtaking it. The market is priced correctly at very high probability.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +6%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Leverkusen at home against K\u00f6ln should be favorites despite their recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg. Leverkusen is a much stronger squad playing at BayArena, and home advantage matters. However, their recent stumble and K\u00f6ln's resilience (2-2 draw previously) introduces uncertainty. The 62% seems slightly low but not enough edge to recommend a trade.\n\nMARKET 3: YES (on Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -2%\nExpected Value: Insufficient for YES; checking NO side\nReasoning: Wait - let me recalculate. Crvena Zvezda (9-5, 3rd place) is significantly outperforming Partizan (5-9, 16th place) in EuroLeague. However, this is a derby match at Partizan's home court, which historically provides strong home advantage in Serbian basketball derbies. The emotional intensity often narrows gaps between teams.\n\nRevised:\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -6%\nExpected Value: Insufficient\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\nThe home court advantage for Partizan in this heated rivalry could narrow the gap, but not enough edge exists on either side to recommend a trade.",
