The lack of official announcements further supports a \"No\" position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The San Jose Sharks have shown recent inconsistency, breaking a losing streak but then losing again shortly after. The Pittsburgh Penguins, despite being inconsistent as well, have home advantage. This context suggests that the Sharks may not be the favored team to win this matchup.",
