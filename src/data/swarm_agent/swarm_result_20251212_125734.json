  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends a YES trade on Market 2 due to a significant edge, with most AIs agreeing the candidate's probability is severely undervalued. For Markets 1 and 3, the consensus is to avoid trading, as the estimated probabilities are either too close to or below the market price to meet the 10% edge threshold. There is minor disagreement on the exact edge for Market 1, but unanimous agreement that it is insufficient for a recommended trade.",

While Curitiba polling isn't nationally representative, being the frontrunner in a major state capital with these numbers suggests 7% dramatically undervalues his chances.
