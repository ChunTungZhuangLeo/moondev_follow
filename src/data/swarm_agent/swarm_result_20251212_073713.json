The Thunder advanced by defeating the Phoenix Suns 138-89, achieving a franchise-record 16-game winning streak and tying the best 25-game start in NBA history at 24-1.

He announced plans to begin issuing these payments by mid-2026, aiming to utilize \"hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money\" for this purpose. ([foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-tariff-funded-dividend-payments-americans-begin-next-year.print?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of this plan. Analysts estimate that such a dividend would cost approximately $600 billion annually, while current tariff revenues are projected to be around $200 to $300 billion per year. This shortfall suggests that the proposed dividend may not be financially sustainable.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear mispricing in Market 2, with most models agreeing the \"YES\" probability is vastly inflated due to Trump's stated 2026 timeline and funding issues, recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Market 1, opinions on the Thunder's edge vary, resulting in no strong trade consensus, while Market 3 shows a split on whether the Cavaliers' spread offers sufficient value. Overall, only Market 2 presents a unified, actionable recommendation with a significant perceived edge.",
