However, recent developments suggest increasing international pressure on his administration, which could influence his tenure.\n\n**U.S. Sanctions and Military Actions**\n\nOn December 11, 2025, the United States imposed new sanctions targeting three nephews of First Lady Cilia Flores and six oil tankers associated with Maduro's regime. The U.S. Treasury accused these entities of facilitating deceptive practices and supporting the Maduro administration, labeling it a \"corrupt narco-terrorist regime.\" ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-sanctions-maduros-nephews-six-ships-carrying-venezuela-oil-says-axios-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, on December 10, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard seized the oil tanker Skipper off Venezuela's coast. The vessel was allegedly transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran, supporting illi...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will there be exactly 2 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher worldwide by December 31?\nRecent trade: $5,428.62 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/how-many-7pt0-or-above-earthquakes-by-december-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there have been four earthquakes worldwide with magnitudes of 7.0 or higher:\n\n1. **December 6, 2025**: A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck near the Alaska-Canada border, approximately 230 miles northwest of Juneau, Alaska. The tremor occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers and was followed by several aftershocks. Despite its strength, there were no immediate reports of injuries or structural damage. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/7c0f68370e387b1b23fa7fe7fc9c2c71?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **December 8, 2025**: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred off the coast of Aomori Prefecture, Japan, at a depth of 44.1 kilometers. The quake resulted in 47 injuries and triggered a tsunami advisory, with waves reaching up to 70 cm along the coast of northern Japan. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Aomori_earthquake?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **December 8, 2025**: A magnitude 6.6 aftershock struck off the coast of Aomori Prefecture, Japan, at a depth of 10...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Real Sociedad de F\u00fatbol vs. Girona FC: O/U 3.5\nRecent trade: $1,216.93 on Over\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/lal-rso-gir-2025-12-12-more-markets\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe upcoming La Liga match between Real Sociedad and Girona FC is scheduled for December 12, 2025, at the Reale Arena in San Sebasti\u00e1n. Recent analyses and statistics provide insight into the potential for over or under 3.5 goals in this fixture.\n\n**Recent Form and Head-to-Head Record:**\n\n- **Real Sociedad:** The team has shown a mixed performance recently, with two wins and three losses in their last five matches. Their attacking unit remains potent, scoring seven goals in this period. However, defensive lapses have been evident, especially against high-pressing offenses. ([tips.gg](https://tips.gg/article/real-sociedad-vs-girona-12-12-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Girona FC:** Girona has struggled in recent outings, securing only one win and suffering three defeats in their last five matches. They have netted just three goals while conceding nearly twice as many. Injuries and disciplinary issues have further compounded their challenges.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Market 2, as all AIs agree that with at least four major earthquakes already recorded, \"exactly 2\" by year-end is impossible. For Market 1, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" but all agree that despite increasing pressure, Maduro's resignation by the deadline is unlikely. For Market 3, the majority lean toward \"NO\" (under 3.5 goals), citing both teams' poor recent offensive form, though some advise caution due to the match's inherent volatility.",

The current situation is complex and unpredictable, making it difficult to confidently bet on a \"Yes\" or \"No\" outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: As of December 12, 2025, there have already been four recorded earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher this year. Therefore, it is impossible for there to be exactly two such earthquakes by December 31, 2025.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The match between Real Sociedad and Girona FC shows potential for either outcome regarding the over/under 3.5 goals line. Real Sociedad's recent form indicates potential for scoring, but Girona's struggles may lead to a low-scoring game. Given the mixed signals from both teams' performances, it's prudent to avoid taking a position.",

The January 2026 timeline is too short for regime change to materialize, but recent escalations create uncertainty that makes this not a clear betting opportunity.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The news confirms there have already been FOUR earthquakes of magnitude 7.0+ as of December 12, 2025 (Alaska 7.0, Japan 7.5, and two others mentioned). Since we're already past 2 earthquakes with 19 days left in the year, \"exactly 2\" is impossible.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Both teams show defensive vulnerabilities but limited attacking output recently - Real Sociedad scored 7 in 5 matches, Girona only 3 in 5 matches.

The provided news explicitly states that as of December 12, 2025, there have already been three such earthquakes (M7.0, M7.5, M7.2), making the \"exactly 2\" condition impossible.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Girona FC has struggled significantly in recent matches, scoring only three goals in their last five outings (0.6 goals/game average), while Real Sociedad's attack is potent but their defense has lapses. Given Girona's low scoring output and overall poor form, it is unlikely the match will exceed 3.5 total goals.",
