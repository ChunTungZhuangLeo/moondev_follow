His Fidesz party has been proactive, selecting candidates for all but a few constituencies, demonstrating readiness for the upcoming electoral contest.

The Mavericks are favored by 8.5 points in this matchup.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Injury Report:** Mavericks center Dereck Lively II will miss the remainder of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a right foot injury requiring surgery. This injury is a recurrence of previous issues with the same foot, which had limited him to 36 games last season and necessitated offseason surgery for bone spurs. Lively has played only seven games this season, averaging 4.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 16.4 minutes per game.

DK secured a decisive victory in Game 3 with a 25-11 score, taking a 2-1 lead in the series. Aiming's performance on Zeri (9/1/11) and ShowMaker's Ryze (6/3/13) were instrumental in this win.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear trade for Market 1, as most AIs see the 55% price as roughly fair with insufficient edge. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement, with AIs split between recommending \"NO\" due to the injury or \"YES\" based on recent team performance. Regarding Market 3, most agree there is no actionable trade, though one AI strongly recommends \"NO\" based on interpreting the event as a past result.",

The market's price closely aligns with my probability estimate, offering insufficient edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 45%  \nMarket Price: 55.0%  \nEdge: -10% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -$0.10 \u00d7 stake  \nReasoning: The Mavericks' recent performance has been strong, winning four of their last five games. However, the loss of Dereck Lively II could impact their defensive capabilities and ability to cover the 8.5-point spread, especially against a potentially competitive Nets team. Thus, I estimate a lower probability of covering the spread.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 75%  \nMarket Price: 75.0%  \nEdge: 0% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: $0.00 \u00d7 stake  \nReasoning: Despite DK's strong performance in Game 3 of the series, HLE's subsequent comeback and advancement to the grand final demonstrate their resilience and capability. The market's probability reflects the balanced nature of this matchup, and there is no significant edge to exploit.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 55%\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Low (3% edge insufficient)\nReasoning: Orb\u00e1n remains the frontrunner with Fidesz well-organized and 50% of Hungarians expecting him to win per recent polling. However, the opposition has been consolidating and economic pressures exist. The market price of 55% seems roughly accurate given uncertainty, but not enough edge to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 55%\nEdge: -13%\nExpected Value: 13% \u00d7 1.22 = ~15.9% return on NO bet\nReasoning: The Mavericks losing Dereck Lively II for the season significantly impacts their interior defense and rebounding. Covering 8.5 points is a large spread, and while Dallas is playing well, the Nets can keep games competitive. The injury news may not be fully priced into this spread market, making NO (Nets +8.5) attractive.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 75%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The search results indicate this match already occurred in February 2025, with DK winning Game 3 specifically (25-11). If this is a historical market that's already resolved, DK won Game 3. However, if it's a new match, the context is unclear. Given the confusion and only 5% potential edge, I cannot recommend a trade with confidence.",

Market price roughly fair - edge too small to justify trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 55%\nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong (+13% \u00d7 $0.45 profit per dollar = ~$0.06 EV)\nReasoning: Mavericks have won 4 of last 5 games and are playing at home. While Lively's season-ending injury is a loss, the 8.5-point spread is reasonable given their recent form. The Nets recently bet suggests value on Mavericks covering, as market hasn't fully adjusted to Dallas momentum.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 75%\nEdge: -5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative (-5% edge, wrong side)\nReasoning: The context describes a PAST match from February 2025 where DK won Game 3 (25-11). If this market is about a future Game 3, DK showed dominance in that game historically, but HLE won the series 3-2. Market slightly overvalues DK at 75%, but -5% edge insufficient for NO trade.",
