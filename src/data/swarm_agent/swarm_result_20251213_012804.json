      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: Given the recent intensification of U.S. anti-cartel operations on foreign soil, particularly with Operation Southern Spear and 22 known lethal strikes in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, it is likely that the U.S. will conduct an anti-cartel strike or operation on foreign soil by December 31.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER\nReasoning: The Memphis Grizzlies' strong recent form, including a 119-96 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers with 69 points from bench players, and the Utah Jazz's integration of rookie Walter Clayton Jr., who recently posted a career-high performance, suggest a high-scoring game, making Over a likely outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Memphis Grizzlies' strong defensive performance, holding the Utah Jazz to 45% shooting in their recent 105-91 victory, and their positive trend of winning seven of their last nine games, make it likely that the Grizzlies will have a strong first half, making a bet on the Jazz less favorable.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: The recent news indicates that the U.S. has already launched Operation Southern Spear, a military and surveillance campaign targeting drug trafficking on foreign soil. This aligns with the criteria of an anti-cartel operation, suggesting that this condition has been met before December 31, 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER  \nReasoning: The Memphis Grizzlies have been in strong form, scoring heavily, particularly with significant contributions from their bench. Given their recent high-scoring games and the Jazz's ongoing integration of rookie players, the total points could likely exceed 233.5.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The Memphis Grizzlies have demonstrated strong defensive performances and have recently beaten the Utah Jazz. With their current positive trend and past victory over the Jazz, it seems likely they will lead at the half in the upcoming game.",
