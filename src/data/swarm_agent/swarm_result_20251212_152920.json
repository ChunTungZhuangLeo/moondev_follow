      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: While JD Vance has Trump's endorsement and is well-positioned as VP, the 2028 election is over 3 years away with many variables. Historical odds of any single candidate winning are low, and the current price likely overestimates his chances given potential primary challengers and general election uncertainty.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The Riyadh Falcons have a dismal 0-14 record across Majors 1 and 2 with the worst Hardpoint performance in the league (-60.6 margin), while Carolina Royal Ravens have a solid 10-4 combined record. The recent $800 trade on Falcons appears to be poor value given this stark performance disparity.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: G2 Minnesota (3-4 in Major 2) has shown improvement over Boston Breach's likely similar or weaker performance, and the recent $800 trade on G2 Minnesota aligns with their marginally better recent form.

Thus, taking a position now would be speculative.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The Riyadh Falcons have performed poorly throughout the 2025 season, with a notably bad record in Major events and a particularly weak Hardpoint performance. In contrast, the Carolina Royal Ravens have had a much stronger record, making a bet on the Falcons risky despite the recent market trade favoring them.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: G2 Minnesota and Boston Breach's recent performances appear competitive, with G2 Minnesota slightly underperforming. However, without clear dominance or significant recent changes for either team, the outcome is uncertain, suggesting caution in taking a position.",
