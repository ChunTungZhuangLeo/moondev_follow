  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's \"Yes\" is massively overvalued, with all models recommending a \"No\" trade due to Valencia's poor form against a strong Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.

Finally, all models identify a significant positive edge in Market 3's \"Over,\" recommending a \"Yes\" trade based on Arsenal's strong attack versus the league's worst team.",
