  "consensus_summary": "All three AI models unanimously recommend betting \"NO\" on Market 1, agreeing the Fed's projection of rate cuts makes a 2026 hike highly improbable, creating a massive negative edge against the 90% market price. For Markets 2 and 3, the consensus is mixed or advises against trading, as the models' true probability estimates are close to or below the market prices, failing to meet the 10% edge threshold. The only clear, actionable trade with a significant consensus edge is on Market 1.",
