Gilgeous-Alexander is dominant. However, 81% already prices in Thunder's excellence. While they should win, the 7% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a trade recommendation despite strong fundamentals.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?\n**Your Probability: 15%**\n**Market Price: 97.5%**\n**Edge: -82.5%**\n**Expected Value: Massive (+82.5% \u00d7 NO payout = highly positive)**\n**Decision: NO**\n\n**Reasoning:** The market resolution requires actual CREATION and DISTRIBUTION in 2025. Trump only announced plans for \"mid-2026\" distribution. With 19 days left in 2025, creating legislation, passing it, and distributing checks is logistically impossible. The market has severely mispriced the timing requirement - this resolves NO.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Cavaliers (-14.5) vs Wizards\n**Your Probability: 68%**\n**Market Price: 52%**\n**Edge: +16%**\n**Expected Value: Strong (+16% \u00d7 payout = excellent value)**\n**Decision: YES**\n\n**Reasoning:** Wizards have NBA's worst defense, worst point differential, and 13-game losing streak to Cavaliers. Despite Cleveland's recent 5-7 stretch, the talent gap is massive. Cavaliers recently beat quality opponents like Spurs by controlling games. 14.5 points against the league's worst team is very achievable. Market undervalues the mismatch at 52%.",
