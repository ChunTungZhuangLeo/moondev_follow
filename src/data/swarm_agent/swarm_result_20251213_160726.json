  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies significant negative edges against the market prices in the first two markets, with all AIs agreeing \"No\" trades on Kanye's visit due to a lack of evidence. There is disagreement on Market 1, as one AI recommends \"No Trade\" while others recommend \"No,\" but all agree the market's ~92% price is overvalued. No trades meet the 10%+ edge threshold for a positive recommendation, as even the agreed-upon \"No\" positions reflect the market's implied probability being higher than the analysts' true estimates.",
