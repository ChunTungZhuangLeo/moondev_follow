GPT-5.2 boasts enhanced general intelligence, improved coding capabilities, and better handling of long-context understanding. Despite the competitive threat posed by Gemini 3, OpenAI's metrics were less impacted than anticipated.

  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly favors Arsenal winning due to their home advantage and opponent's poor record, while opinions are split on the AI market between \"Yes\" and \"No Trade\" due to competitive parity between Google and OpenAI. There is significant disagreement on the Army-Navy game, with most models favoring Navy based on season records but one dissenting based on betting activity and rivalry unpredictability. Overall, predictions for Arsenal are unified, but the other two markets lack clear agreement, reflecting higher uncertainty.",

Despite a recent defeat, Arsenal's strong performance in the Champions League suggests they are in good form overall. This, combined with Wolverhampton's poor record, makes a victory for Arsenal highly likely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 are both highly advanced AI models with significant achievements. While Google's model is currently considered one of the most advanced, OpenAI's recent release maintains strong competitive metrics. The competition between these two makes it uncertain which will be regarded as the top AI model by year's end, thus warranting no trade.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Army being the defending AAC champions, Navy has a stronger record this season at 9-2 and has been ranked in the AP Top 25. Navy's stronger performance this season and their historical rivalry advantage should give them the edge in this matchup.",

The resolution criteria for \"top AI model\" is unclear and subjective, making this too uncertain to trade confidently.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Navy enters at 9-2 with Top 25 ranking versus Army's 6-5 record.
