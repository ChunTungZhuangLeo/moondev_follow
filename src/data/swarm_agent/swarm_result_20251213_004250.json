This marks the first meeting between the two teams this season.\n\n**Recent Performances:**\n\n- **Ottawa Senators:** In their most recent game on December 12, 2025, the Senators secured a 6-3 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. Tim Stutzle led the team with two goals, snapping a five-game losing streak. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/nhl/tim-stutzles-2-goals-propel-senators-past-blue-jackets--flm-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Minnesota Wild:** The Wild are coming off a 4-1 win against the Seattle Kraken on December 8, 2025. Joel Eriksson Ek contributed a goal and two assists in that game.

On December 11, Russian military commanders reported to President Vladimir Putin that their forces had captured Siversk, a town in the Donetsk region. They claimed this victory was a significant step toward advancing toward Sloviansk, another major city still under Ukrainian control. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commanders-tell-putin-that-russia-has-captured-siversk-eastern-ukraine-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian military has firmly denied these claims. In a statement, they asserted that Siversk remains under Ukrainian control, despite ongoing Russian attempts to infiltrate the area. They also reported continued resistance in the northern districts of Pokrovsk, challenging Russian assertions of control there.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced the truce after discussions with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, with mediation support from Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8c7dd464da0c8914e07c7e1146a9ce8c?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe renewed ceasefire aims to restore the peace accord initially brokered in July 2025, which had been suspended in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines along the border. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/11/thailand-cambodia-peace-deal-suspended/?utm_source=openai)) The recent escalation resulted in at least 20 deaths and displaced hundreds of thousands, highlighting the fragility of the previous agreements.

This is essentially a coin flip with slight home advantage to Minnesota.

This is a \"fog of war\" situation where conflicting reports exist. The market is overpricing Russian claims at 89% when Ukrainian denial and continued fighting suggests much lower probability of confirmed Russian control by Dec 22.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Your Probability:** 98%\n**Market Price:** 95.6%\n**Edge:** +2.4% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +2.4%\n**Reasoning:** A ceasefire was just agreed to and is already in effect as of December 13, with U.S. presidential mediation and Malaysian support.
