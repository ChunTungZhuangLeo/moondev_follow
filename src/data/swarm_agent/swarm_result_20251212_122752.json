  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Lula is likely to qualify for the runoff, with most models estimating a probability above the market price, though only one finds a sufficient edge to recommend a trade. For the football matches, there is clear agreement that the market overvalues Dynamo Dresden's chance of winning, while views on Eintracht Frankfurt are mixed but cluster near the market price. Overall, the only trade recommendation meeting the 10% edge threshold across multiple analyses is a YES on Lula qualifying, based on his incumbency advantage.",

Brazil's two-round system historically favors major party candidates, and Lula has consistently been a top-two finisher in every election he's contested. The Bolsonaro camp is fractured with Fl\u00e1vio (not Jair) running, reducing right-wing consolidation. Incumbents almost always make the runoff.\n\n**Decision: YES**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will SG Dynamo Dresden win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 38%\nMarket Price: 43%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: Dresden is playing at home but has a dismal home record (1 win in 7 matches) and just lost 1-3 to Kaiserslautern. They sit below Braunschweig in the table (17th vs 14th). While home advantage exists, their poor home form and defensive issues suggest the market is slightly overpricing their win probability.

However, the 2026 election is still 18+ months away, and Brazilian politics is highly volatile. The market at 74% already prices in his strong position as frontrunner. While I estimate slightly higher at 78% due to incumbency advantage, this 4% edge is insufficient for a trade recommendation.\n\nDecision: **NO_TRADE** - Edge below 10% threshold despite favorable probability.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Will SG Dynamo Dresden win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 43%\nEdge: +12% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+12% \u00d7 2.33 payout = +28% EV)\n\nReasoning: Dresden hosts Braunschweig in a relegation battle at Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion. Despite poor overall home form (1 win in 7), Dresden has won 3 of last 5 matches showing recent improvement. Braunschweig is only marginally better in standings (14th vs 17th). Home advantage in a desperate relegation match is undervalued at 43%. The market appears to overweight Dresden's poor home record without considering recent form momentum.\n\nDecision: **YES** - Market significantly undervalues home advantage and recent form.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Will Eintracht Frankfurt win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 60%\nMarket Price: 57%\nEdge: +3% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal (insufficient edge)\n\nReasoning: Frankfurt hosts Augsburg with a 56% win probability per predictions, closely aligned with the 57% market price. While Frankfurt has home advantage, their defensive issues (29 goals conceded - worst in Bundesliga) and offensive struggles (6 goals in 5 matches) create uncertainty. The market has efficiently priced this match with only 3% difference from my estimate.\n\nDecision: **NO_TRADE** - Market fairly priced, insufficient edge for profitable trade.",
