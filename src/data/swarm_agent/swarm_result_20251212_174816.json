([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_2025?utm_source=openai)) This includes significant events such as the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Kamchatka, Russia, on July 30, 2025, and the 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. ([time.com](https://time.com/7306379/kamchatka-earthquake-magnitude-russia-tsunami-warning-japan-alaska-hawaii-california/?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the current rate of approximately 1.5 magnitude 7.0+ earthquakes per month, it is likely that at least 8 more such earthquakes will occur by June 30, 2026. However, predicting the exact number of future earthquakes is challenging due to the complex and unpredictable nature of seismic activity.\n\nRecent seismic events, such as the 7.5 magnitude earthquake off Japan's northeastern coast on December 8, 2025, and the 7.0 magnitude earthquake along the Alaska-Canada border on Dec...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will the Republican Party control the Senate after the 2026 Midterm elections?\nRecent trade: $1,320.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/which-party-will-win-the-senate-in-2026\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority in the U.S. Senate. Looking ahead to the 2026 midterm elections, several factors suggest that Republicans are well-positioned to retain control of the Senate.\n\n**Current Senate Composition and Upcoming Elections**\n\nIn 2026, 35 of the 100 Senate seats will be contested. Republicans are defending 21 seats, while Democrats are defending 14. Notably, several Republican-held seats are in states that have trended Democratic in recent presidential elections, such as Georgia and Michigan. However, the Cook Political Report indicates that Republicans have an advantage in these races, listing both Georgia and Michigan as toss-ups.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) states that neither they nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake, and they do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. ([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/faqs/can-you-predict-earthquakes?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, recent seismic activity and scientific studies provide context for understanding the potential for such events:\n\n- **Japan's Megaquake Advisory**: On December 9, 2025, Japan issued a rare advisory for a potential \"megaquake\" (magnitude 8.0 or higher) along the northern Pacific coast, particularly near the Hokkaido and Sanriku regions. This followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake off Aomori Prefecture, which caused minor injuries and tsunami waves up to 2 feet high. The Japan Meteorological Agency highlighted a heightened chance of a larger earthquake within the coming week due to seismic...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

Given we're analyzing through June 30, 2026, and the historical rate easily supports 8+ events in a 6-month period, this threshold will almost certainly be met.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Republicans currently hold a 53-47 Senate majority and while defending more seats in 2026, the Cook Political Report shows them with structural advantages. Democrats would need to flip 4 seats in a historically challenging midterm environment, making Republican retention the more probable outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Magnitude 9.0+ earthquakes are extremely rare events (only 5 recorded since 1900), and while Japan has issued a megaquake advisory, the base rate probability of such an event occurring in any given year is very low (roughly 4-5% annually).
