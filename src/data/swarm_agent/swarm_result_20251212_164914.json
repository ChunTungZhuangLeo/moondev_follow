  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will the Fed decrease interest rates by 50+ bps after the March 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 8.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $598.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-march-885\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not provided specific guidance regarding a 50+ basis point (bps) interest rate decrease following its March 2026 meeting. The most recent rate cut occurred in December 2025, reducing the federal funds rate to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%. This decision was accompanied by projections indicating only one additional 25 bps rate cut in 2026. ([tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate/news/463954?utm_source=openai))\n\nMarket expectations, as reflected in prediction markets, suggest a low probability of a 50+ bps rate decrease in March 2026. For instance, a Polymarket event indicates a 2.1% chance of such a reduction. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-march-885/will-the-fed-decrease-interest-rates-by-50-bps-after-the-march-2026-meeting?utm_source=openai))\n\nAnalyst forecasts also align with the Fed's cautious stance. Goldman Sachs anticipates that the Fed will pause its rate-cutting cyc\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 240-259 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.9% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $5,324.51 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet activity between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been actively assessing this period. On Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been trading on the likelihood of Musk posting a certain number of tweets during this timeframe.\n\nThe market with the highest trading volume focuses on the range of 360-379 tweets, with a 12.1% chance of occurrence. Other notable ranges include 400-419 tweets at 10.8%, 420-439 tweets at 10.5%, and 380-399 tweets at 10.3%. The 240-259 tweets range, which is the specific focus of your query, has a 12% chance of occurring.

However, recent seismic activity has heightened concerns, particularly in Japan.\n\n**Recent Seismic Activity:**\n\n- **Japan:** On December 8, a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Aomori Prefecture, causing injuries to at least 34 people and triggering tsunami warnings. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/japan-warns-3-metre-high-tsunami-after-magnitude-72-earthquake-2025-12-08/?utm_source=openai)) Following this, a 6.9-magnitude aftershock occurred on December 12, leading to a tsunami advisory that was later lifted. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/6c97a2ed0eae607f5b49a9cf371c7725?utm_source=openai)) The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued a rare \"megaquake\" advisory, indicating a slight increase in the risk of a magnitude 8 or higher earthquake along Japan's northeastern coast within the coming week.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear mispricing in Market 2, with all AIs agreeing the 97.9% price is vastly overvalued compared to the ~12% true probability, making a \"NO\" trade strongly recommended. For Market 1, there is agreement the true probability is very low (2-5%), but insufficient edge for a trade as the market price is only moderately higher. On Market 3, opinions diverge significantly on the true probability (30-92%), showing no reliable consensus for an actionable edge.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 8.0%\nEdge: -3% (5% - 8%)\nExpected Value: Low negative\nReasoning: The Fed just cut rates in December 2025 and projected only one additional 25 bps cut in 2026. A 50+ bps cumulative decrease by March 2026 would require aggressive cutting that contradicts current Fed guidance. The market at 8% already reflects this low probability, and my estimate of ~5% doesn't provide sufficient edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 97.9%\nEdge: -85.9% (12% - 97.9%)\nReasoning: The web search context clearly states the 240-259 tweet range has only a 12% chance according to Polymarket's own broader market, with higher probability ranges being 360-419 tweets. A 97.9% price on this specific narrow range is massively mispriced - this appears to be a data error or the market is about to resolve. The most likely ranges suggest Musk tweets far more than 240-259, making this a strong NO.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 89.3%\nEdge: +2.7% (92% - 89.3%)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake already struck Japan on December 8, and there's been significant aftershock activity including a 6.9 on December 12. If this market asks about \"another\" 7.0+ earthquake, one has likely already occurred this period. However, the market is already pricing this very high at 89.3%, and my slightly higher estimate doesn't provide the 10% edge threshold needed.",

A 50+bps cut in March would require significant economic deterioration, which current data doesn't support. Market is slightly overpricing this already-unlikely event.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 97.9%\nEdge: -95.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: This market is SEVERELY mispriced. The web context shows the 240-259 range has only 12% probability on the main tweet-counting market, yet this binary market prices it at 97.9%. Either there's been a recent dramatic shift in his posting pattern OR this is arbitrage opportunity. Based on distribution data showing multiple ranges (360-379 at 12.1%, 400-419 at 10.8%), the 240-259 range is actually LOW probability. **STRONG NO RECOMMENDATION.**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 95%\nMarket Price: 89.3%\nEdge: +5.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive\nReasoning: Japan just experienced a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Dec 8 and a 6.9 aftershock on Dec 12. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a rare \"megaquake advisory\" warning of increased risk of magnitude 8+ earthquake within the coming week. With heightened seismic activity and official warnings, probability of another 7.0+ by Dec 15 (only 3 days away) is HIGHER than market price. However, edge is below 10% threshold for strong recommendation - borderline NO_TRADE, but leaning YES given the official advisory and recent pattern.\n\n**REVISED: NO_TRADE** - Edge insufficient at 5.7%\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- **Market 1**: NO_TRADE (insufficient edge, already low probability)\n- **Market 2**: **STRONG NO** (massive mispricing, 95.9% edge)\n- **Market 3**: NO_TRADE (positive edge but below 10% threshold)\n\n**Only Market 2 meets the 10%+ edge criteria for a trade recommendation.**",
