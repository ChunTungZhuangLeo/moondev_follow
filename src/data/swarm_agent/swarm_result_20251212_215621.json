In the lead-up to this game, there have been significant developments:\n\n- **Coaching Change at Partizan**: Reports from December 9, 2025, suggest that Joan Pe\u00f1arroya is a potential candidate to replace the legendary Zeljko Obradovic as head coach of Partizan. Pe\u00f1arroya, 56, has previously coached in Spain and is currently without a team after his tenure with FC Barcelona.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong negative edge on Market 1, with most models estimating the true probability for \"Stranger Things\" is significantly below the 95.8% market price, favoring a \"NO\" bet. For Market 2, opinions are split between a \"YES\" bet with a positive edge and a \"NO\" or no trade, reflecting disagreement on interpreting Leverkusen's recent form.

By December 16 (week 3-4), viewership typically continues declining. While likely still #1, the 95.8% price leaves minimal margin for error given natural viewership decay patterns.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is less than 10% threshold\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13% edge on home favorite)\nReasoning: Leverkusen plays at home (BayArena) against relegation-threatened K\u00f6ln. Despite recent struggles (loss to Augsburg, draw vs Newcastle), Leverkusen is defending Bundesliga champions. Historical head-to-head heavily favors Leverkusen, and K\u00f6ln is fighting relegation. Home advantage plus quality gap suggests 75%+ win probability.\n\n**Decision: YES** - 13% edge exceeds threshold\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -12.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Market prices Crvena Zvezda at 74% but Partizan won their last meeting 89-77 at home in November 2024. With coaching uncertainty at Partizan (Pe\u00f1arroya potentially replacing Obradovic announced after this game), there's instability. However, 74% overvalues Zvezda in this volatile derby rivalry. True probability closer to 60-65% for Zvezda.\n\n**Decision: NO** - 12% edge on NO side exceeds threshold",

(December 16, 2025)**\n\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -3.8%\nExpected Value: Minimal\n\nReasoning: Despite the 60% viewership decline in week 2, Stranger Things 5 remains a cultural juggernaut with no comparable competition on Netflix right now. The drop is typical for big releases, and 23.6M views still dominates. However, we're now in week 3-4 territory where fatigue could set in. The market at 95.8% is slightly high but within reasonable range.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge insufficient (only ~4% potential edge on NO side)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 62%\nEdge: +10%\nExpected Value: +10% \u00d7 0.61 = +6.1% return\n\nReasoning: Leverkusen at home against K\u00f6ln is a massive mismatch. Despite the recent Augsburg loss (2-0), that was away and Grimaldo was injured - he's now back (scored vs Newcastle). K\u00f6ln is a significantly weaker opponent, and Leverkusen's home record is excellent. The historical head-to-head strongly favors Leverkusen. Market seems to be overreacting to the Augsburg loss.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Home favorite against weaker opponent with key player returning\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Partizan vs. KK Crvena Zvezda**\n\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 74% (for Crvena Zvezda)\nEdge: -6%\nExpected Value: Insufficient\n\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda is the stronger EuroLeague team generally, but Partizan won the last meeting 89-77 and has home advantage. The coaching uncertainty around Obradovic's potential departure could either motivate or distract Partizan. Derby matches are inherently volatile. 74% for the away team seems slightly high given recent H2H results.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge below 10% threshold; derby unpredictability makes this risky",
