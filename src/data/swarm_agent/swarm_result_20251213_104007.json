  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends \"NO\" trades on both Hyperliquid markets due to unanimous agreement that their current near-zero prices make the multi-million-fold increases to $54 or $62 by 2026 astronomically unlikely, creating large negative edges versus the market. For the Liverpool vs. Brighton match, opinions are split and more nuanced, with most models showing a slight negative edge for the \"Under,\" leading to a \"NO_TRADE\" or \"NO\" recommendation. Overall, the only potential actionable trade with a significant positive edge was a single outlier \"YES\" on the soccer match, which contradicts the cautious consensus of the other three models.",
