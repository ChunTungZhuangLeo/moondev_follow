  "consensus_summary": "Consensus shows strong agreement that the Buccaneers are unlikely to cover the -6.5 spread due to the line discrepancy and injury uncertainties, while opinions are split on the Over/Under due to conflicting interpretations of how those injuries affect scoring. For the CS2 match, most models favor Vitality based on recent form and betting activity, though some caution exists due to the teams' split history. Overall, the clearest consensus is a \"NO\" prediction for Market 1 and a \"Vitality\" prediction for Market 3, with Market 2 remaining more divided.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The Buccaneers are favored by 4.5 points, but the spread on this market is -6.5, and with the uncertainty surrounding Baker Mayfield's availability and the recent activation of wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan, the situation is too volatile to make a confident bet.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Given the uncertainty around key players' availability, such as Baker Mayfield and the questionable status of Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan, it's reasonable to expect a lower-scoring game, potentially leading to an under outcome on the over/under of 44.5 points.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Considering the recent matchups between Vitality and TheMongolZ, where each team has had victories, it's a closely contested series, but Vitality's ability to come back from a loss to win a series, as seen in the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, suggests they have the resilience and skill to win Map 2 against TheMongolZ.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The spread for the Buccaneers is listed at -6.5, but recent news indicates they are only favored by 4.5 points. Additionally, key players like Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan are questionable, and quarterback Baker Mayfield's status is uncertain, making it less likely that the Buccaneers will cover a 6.5-point spread.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While the Buccaneers have activated important wide receivers, their questionable status, combined with the uncertainty around Mayfield's participation, introduces too much variability in the game's scoring potential. Additionally, the Falcons' elimination from playoff contention could affect their performance unpredictably, making the over/under bet riskier.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Despite recent losses to The MongolZ, Vitality has demonstrated the ability to overcome them in significant matches, including a 2-0 victory at IEM Cologne 2025. Recent betting also shows strong confidence in Vitality, supporting a bet on them as the Map 2 winner.",

With Baker Mayfield's uncertain status due to shoulder injury and key receivers just returning from IR as questionable, covering 6.5 points is unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: Under\nReasoning: With Mayfield's injury concerns, Evans and McMillan questionable after extended absences, and Atlanta eliminated from playoffs (likely reduced motivation), offensive production could be limited. The recent large trade on Under aligns with these factors suggesting a lower-scoring game.\n\nMARKET 3: Vitality\nReasoning: Vitality has shown strong recent form, winning the Austin Major over TheMongolz and taking IEM Cologne 2-0 against them. While TheMongolz won at Esports World Cup, Vitality's overall head-to-head record and major tournament success suggests they're the stronger team on Map 2.",

These factors support a lower-scoring game.\n\nMARKET 3: VITALITY\nReasoning: Recent head-to-head shows competitive matches with split results, but the $2,217.60 recent bet on Vitality suggests sharp money favors them for Map 2 specifically. Vitality has shown strong map-by-map resilience (winning Austin Major 2-1 after losing Map 1), making them the stronger play for a single map.",
