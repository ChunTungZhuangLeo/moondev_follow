Bannon, who served as a senior advisor to Trump, was pardoned in January 2021 for federal charges related to the \"We Build the Wall\" fundraising campaign. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardons-former-chief-strategist-steve-bannon/?utm_source=openai)) However, in February 2025, Bannon pleaded guilty to a state felony charge in New York for defrauding donors in the same campaign, resulting in a three-year conditional discharge.

Following the pardon of Rudy Giuliani, Bannon's odds of receiving a pardon nearly doubled on prediction markets, rising from about 6% to 11%.
