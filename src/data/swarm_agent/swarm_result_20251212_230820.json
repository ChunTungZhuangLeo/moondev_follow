For Market 2, all models see the price as slightly too high, but the edge is below the 10% threshold, resulting in a unanimous \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation.

PSG is 2nd in league, Metz is 18th and struggling (34 goals conceded in 15 games). PSG should win comfortably. The 85% price appears to be for NO (not a draw), which seems reasonable. If 85% is actually the YES price for a draw, this is severely mispriced - true probability of draw is ~12%.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market structure unclear. If 85% is for \"No Draw\" then it's fairly priced.

Presidential races are volatile, and an independent military figure could split traditional center-right votes. 72.8% seems overconfident given competitive field and 2+ months until election.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Market overvalues Mendes by ~28%.

Hawks are 14-11, just snapped 3-game losing streak against weak Wizards. Pistons at home with Cunningham/Duren playing well should cover -5.5 easily. Market undervaluing home court advantage and form differential.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong value on Pistons -5.5. The 19-5 record and home dominance isn't fully priced into 56% market probability.
