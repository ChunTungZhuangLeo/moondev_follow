  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly identifies Market 3 as severely mispriced, with all models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to its excessive 92.8% price for an away team with poor form, representing the clearest high-edge opportunity. For Market 1, most agree on a \"NO\" position due to the Blues' injuries and poor performance, though the estimated edge varies. Regarding Market 2, opinions are split between a slight \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" indicating no strong consensus for a high-conviction bet.",
