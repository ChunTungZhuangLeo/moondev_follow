Both teams are aiming to break recent losing streaks: the Bulls have lost seven consecutive games, while the Hornets have dropped three of their last four.

Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for improved team effort and attention to detail.

([newsminimalist.com](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/collector-buys-every-first-edition-kabuto-pokemon-card-driving-up-prices-0badf591?utm_source=openai)) This unprecedented collecting spree has made the Kabuto card the most valuable non-holo in the Fossil set, surpassing traditionally sought-after cards.\n\nIn early December 2025, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card for charity, with the auction concluding at $51,100. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-auction-autographed-card-154500572.html?utm_source=openai)) This event garnered widespread attention, further elevating the card's profile and value.\n\nGiven the current trajectory and the collector's ongoi\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has not yet announced any interest rate changes for its January 2026 meeting. The most recent rate adjustment occurred in December 2025, when the Fed reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%\u20133.75%. This decision followed similar reductions in September and October 2025, bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since 2022. ([tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate/news/463954?utm_source=openai))\n\nLooking ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has indicated a cautious approach to future rate cuts. In its December 2025 meeting, the FOMC maintained projections for only one additional 25 basis point cut in 2026, consistent with its September 2025 outlook. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/brokerages-stick-with-us-rate-cut-forecasts-despite-fed-caution-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite the Fed's cautious stance, several financial institutions con\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong 25% edge to buy \"YES\" on the Kabuto card market, with most models agreeing the price surge and collector manipulation are undervalued. For the NBA game, analysts largely agree there is no clear edge, viewing it as a toss-up between two struggling teams. Regarding the Fed, opinions are split on direction, but there is no unified 10%+ edge recommendation for a trade.",

The charity auction of a signed card at $51k is irrelevant to regular card prices. Kabuto King's buying spree may slow, and organic demand for a non-holo card hitting $100 in this timeframe is unlikely without continued artificial manipulation.\n\nDecision: NO\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -69% (12% - 81%)\nExpected Value: -69% \u00d7 5.26 = -363% (strong NO)\nReasoning: Wait - the context says Fed just cut in December 2025 and projected only ONE additional cut in all of 2026. The Fed explicitly signaled a \"cautious approach\" to future cuts. A January cut would be back-to-back cuts which contradicts their stated guidance.

A signed card sold for $51,100 in charity auction. With 19 days remaining and current momentum, $100 price point is achievable given the artificial scarcity and media attention.

FOMC projections show only ONE additional 25bp cut planned for ALL of 2026. January is too soon after December cut - Fed typically pauses between cuts to assess impact.
