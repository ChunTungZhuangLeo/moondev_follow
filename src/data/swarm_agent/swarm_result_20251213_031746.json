Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet activity between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been established to estimate his tweeting frequency during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, users can place bets on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market is structured with various ranges of tweet counts, each associated with a probability percentage. For example, the range of 280-299 tweets has a 4.5% chance of occurring, while the 320-339 range has a 7% chance.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly identifies Market 2 (Team Spirit) as a clear YES trade with a significant positive edge, as all AIs agree its true win probability is substantially higher than the market price. For Market 1, there is major disagreement on interpreting the confusing market data, leading most to recommend NO_TRADE, though some argue for a NO bet if the price is indeed inverted. Regarding Market 3, analysts universally advise NO_TRADE due to a lack of specific match data, resulting in no actionable edge.",

The 85.2% price appears to be a data error or I'm misreading the market structure. Given there are multiple tweet count ranges and this is just one narrow band, the true probability of hitting exactly 280-299 is likely 5-10%, not 85%.\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +13%\nExpected Value: 13% \u00d7 3.45 = +44.8% return\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after strong performance, has highest viewership/fan engagement, and pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (18%) have improved significantly. With only 4 teams remaining (semifinal stage), base probability is 25%, but Spirit's demonstrated form and momentum suggest ~40%+ win probability.

In CS2 Bo3 matches, going to 3 maps (Over 2.5) happens roughly 40-55% of the time depending on team skill parity. Without specific team matchup data, I estimate close to 50/50, providing insufficient edge for a trade.",

This appears to be a data error or the question is inverted (likely asking \"will he NOT post 280-299\"). Without clarity on current tweet count (we're on Dec 13, halfway through), and given typical Musk averages ~40 tweets/day would put him at 320+ for the week, this range is unlikely. However, the pricing confusion makes this untradeable.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +16% \u00d7 2.45x payout = +39.2%\nReasoning: Team Spirit is IN THE SEMIFINALS with the grand final on Dec 14 (tomorrow). They demolished Falcons 2-0, lead tournament viewership at 560K average, and had pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15-18% implied). Being in the final four with only 2-3 matches left, their true probability should be 25-50% depending on bracket. At 29% market price for a semifinalist in a strong position, this is undervalued.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +12.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +12% \u00d7 2.0x payout = +24%\nReasoning: This is CS2 match Team Spirit vs Vitality on Dec 13 (likely the semifinal mentioned in Market 2). CS:GO/CS2 major playoffs historically see 65-70% of matches go over 2.5 maps in best-of-3 semifinals between top teams. Both teams are elite (in semifinals), making a close 2-1 series more likely than a sweep. The 50% market price doesn't account for competitive semifinal dynamics where over 2.5 maps hits 60-65% of the time.",
