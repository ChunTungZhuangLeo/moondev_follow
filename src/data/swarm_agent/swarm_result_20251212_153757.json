Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. Joel Embiid struggled offensively, shooting 4-of-21 and scoring 16 points.

Despite initial claims of strong demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" program was launched in February 2025, offering wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to replace the existing EB-5 visa program, focusing on direct financial contributions rather than job creation.

He suggested that the program could generate $5 trillion if one million cards were sold.

However, recent developments suggest increasing international pressure on his administration.\n\n**U.S. Sanctions and Military Actions**\n\nOn December 10, 2025, the United States seized the VLCC Skipper, a large oil tanker off Venezuela's coast, accusing it of transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. President Donald Trump described the vessel as the largest ever seized, suggesting the U.S. would retain the oil aboard. Venezuela condemned the move as \"piracy\" and \"theft,\" arguing that U.S. actions are driven by interest in its natural resources. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0a148ba01684fc6ce1a228dd276732c0?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe following day, December 11, 2025, the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions targeting three nephews of Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores and six crude oil tankers.

The Pacers have shown improvement, winning two recent games, making the outcome uncertain.

Pacers have momentum with two straight wins. A 6.5 point spread is substantial, and this game could easily be within that margin. No meaningful edge exists.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -72%\nExpected Value: 72% \u00d7 ~0.15 = ~10.8% return on NO bet\nReasoning: The news explicitly states Commerce Secretary Lutnick claimed 1,000 Gold Cards were sold in March 2025. Even if this number is exaggerated or disputed, it's extremely unlikely that ZERO cards were sold throughout all of 2025. The 87% YES price seems completely mispriced given the reported sales.

The U.S. seizing oil tankers creates tension but doesn't threaten regime stability directly. 61% is far too high for a 3.5 month window.",

Pacers have won 2 straight and are trending up. The market price of 46.7% for 76ers covering -6.5 is roughly accurate given Embiid's inconsistency and Pacers' momentum. Edge too small to justify trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -12.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +12% \u00d7 payout on NO side\nReasoning: The market is significantly overpricing the probability of ZERO sales. Commerce Secretary Lutnick claimed 1,000 Gold Cards sold in March 2025 at $5M each. Even if these claims are exaggerated, the program has been operational for 10 months of 2025. The likelihood of literally zero sales across the entire year is substantially lower than 87%.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -26.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +26% \u00d7 payout on NO side\nReasoning: Despite increasing U.S. pressure (oil tanker seizures, fresh sanctions on Dec 10-11), Maduro has survived similar or worse pressure for years. No credible intelligence suggests imminent regime change by March 31, 2026 (only 3.5 months away). The market is dramatically overestimating the probability of his removal in this short timeframe. Authoritarian leaders rarely fall this quickly without military defection or popular uprising, neither of which appears imminent.",
