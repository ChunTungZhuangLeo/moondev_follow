In an October 2025 interview, she stated, \"I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now,\" indicating that a decision is forthcoming. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/kamala-harris-2028-election/?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent polling data presents a mixed picture of Harris's standing among potential Democratic contenders. A November 2025 survey by Echelon Insights showed Harris leading with 24% support among likely Democratic voters, followed by California Governor Gavin Newsom at 15% and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 10%.

The latest iteration, Grok 4.20, demonstrated its capabilities by winning the Alpha Arena live trading competition held from December 5 to 7, 2025. This victory marked Grok 4.20 as the only major model to finish profitably in the competition, outperforming models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The model achieved average returns of 12.11%, turning an initial investment of $10,000 into approximately $11,211, with specific runs reaching peaks of 47-50%, aligning with about $14,700 in one instance.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as having the strongest agreement for a \"NO\" trade due to a severe perceived overpricing of Kamala Harris's nomination probability. For Market 1, most analysts see a slight edge for Team Falcons but agree it's below the 10% threshold, recommending no trade. Market 3 also shows a leaning toward \"NO,\" though with less consensus on the degree of mispricing compared to Market 2.",

Harris hasn't declared, recent polling shows her at only 5-24% among Democrats, she lost the 2024 election, and the nomination is 3 years away with many viable alternatives (Newsom, Buttigieg, etc.). Historical precedent shows losing nominees rarely get renominated.

While Grok 4.20 won one trading competition, \"top AI model\" is subjective and typically measured by benchmarks where OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google remain highly competitive. GPT-5.2 just launched. One competition win doesn't make xAI definitively #1 across all metrics. The 97.9% price suggests near-certainty that seems unjustified - strong NO.",
