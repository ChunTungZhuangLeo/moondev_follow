  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no recommended trades, as all AIs found insufficient edge (below 10%) in Markets 1 and 2, while strongly agreeing that Market 3 is significantly overpriced. There is notable disagreement on the true probabilities, especially for Market 1 where estimates range from 30% to 40%, but unanimous agreement that none meet the trading threshold. Overall, the analysis suggests the markets are efficiently priced or mispriced against the trade criteria, yielding no actionable opportunities.",
