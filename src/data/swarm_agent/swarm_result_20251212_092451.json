  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no AI recommends trading Market 1 or 2, as all see insufficient edge below the 10% threshold, with most estimating draw probabilities close to or below the market prices. For Market 3, there is strong agreement to bet \"NO,\" as all models judge the true probability (70-85%) is significantly lower than the market's 95.8%, indicating a clear negative edge against the \"YES\" position. Overall, the analyses agree that only Market 3 presents a decisive trading opportunity, which is to bet against 'Arc Raiders' winning.",

Historical Ligue 1 draw rates hover around 25-28%. Angers being the stronger side at home slightly reduces draw probability, but edge is minimal.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will US Lecce vs. Pisa SC end in a draw?**\n\nYour Probability: 30%\nMarket Price: 35%\nEdge: -5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: Head-to-head shows 0 draws in last 5 meetings (Lecce won 2, Pisa won 3), suggesting these teams tend to produce decisive results.

Historical Ligue 1 draw rate is ~25-28%. Angers' momentum suggests they're slight favorites to win at home, making draw slightly overpriced at 30.7%, but not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Will US Lecce vs. Pisa SC end in a draw?**\n\nYour Probability: 32%\nMarket Price: 35.0%\nEdge: -3.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Head-to-head shows 0 draws in last 5 meetings (2 Lecce wins, 3 Pisa wins).

While Arc Raiders had strong November sales (7.7M copies) and 700K concurrent players, the Steam Awards GOTY is user-voted across ALL games released in the eligibility period. Major competitors likely include Elden Ring DLC, Baldur's Gate 3 (if eligible), and other AAA releases. A 95.8% probability suggests near-certainty, but multiplayer-focused games rarely dominate GOTY categories against single-player narrative experiences. The recent $2,807 NO bet signals informed money recognizing this mispricing.\n\n**STRONG NO RECOMMENDATION - This represents exceptional value on the NO side.**",
