  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1 as likely mispriced, with most analysts agreeing the high price corresponds to \"No\" (he won't leave), making a trade unclear. For Market 2, opinions are split between \"Over\" and \"Under\" due to conflicting factors like Wembanyama's return versus OKC's defense, resulting in no strong agreement. Market 3 shows general disagreement with the listed price favoring T1, as Dplus KIA's Game 1 victory suggests a closer matchup.",

But the news clearly states he remains in his position as of December 2025. With only ~18 days left in 2025, and no indication he's leaving, the probability he leaves should be very LOW (around 8%). The market price seems inverted or there's confusion. If the market is truly 96.2% that he WILL leave, this is massively mispriced.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Spurs vs. Thunder: O/U 224.5**\n\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 54.7% (Over)\nEdge: -12.7% (42% - 54.7%)\nExpected Value: Betting Under at ~45.3% when true probability is ~58%\n\nReasoning: Thunder have the league's best defense (106.2 PPG allowed). Wembanyama is returning but on minutes restriction, limiting Spurs' offensive ceiling. The actual line is 226.5 per news, and Thunder's defensive prowess in a playoff-style game suggests Under is more likely. NBA Cup semifinal games tend to be tighter, lower-scoring affairs.\n\n**Decision: NO** (bet Under)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: LoL: Dplus KIA vs T1 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 67.6% (T1)\nEdge: -12.6% (55% - 67.6%)\nExpected Value: Betting DK at ~32.4% when true probability is ~45%\n\nReasoning: The news context shows that in their recent 2025 LCK Playoffs matchup, Dplus KIA actually WON Game 1 decisively (16-6). While T1 won the series, DK has demonstrated Game 1 strength. Market may be overvaluing T1's overall reputation while ignoring DK's specific Game 1 performance pattern.\n\n**Decision: NO** (bet Dplus KIA)",

He's currently serving as Deputy FBI Director with Trump's public support. Despite July tensions, he remains in position as of December 13. With only 18 days left in 2025, departure is highly unlikely. The 96.2% appears to be pricing NO (won't leave), which aligns with reality.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - The market is correctly priced. The 96.2% likely represents the probability he WON'T leave (betting NO on departure).\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 40%\nMarket Price: 54.7%\nEdge: -14.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -14.7% \u00d7 payout = Strong negative EV\nReasoning: The line is 224.5 (Polymarket) vs 226.5 (sportsbooks). Thunder allows only 106.2 PPG (league-best defense). Wembanyama returning with minutes restriction limits Spurs' scoring. Thunder's elite defense should keep this under 225. Market overvalues the over.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Bet UNDER. Market significantly overvalues the over at 54.7%. True probability closer to 40%.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 67.6%\nEdge: -2.6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal negative\nReasoning: The context shows a PAST playoff series where DK won Game 1 but T1 won 3-1 overall. This appears to be a FUTURE match on December 13, 2025. Without current form data, head-to-head history suggests competitive matchup. T1 at 67.6% seems fairly priced given their historical strength and comeback ability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge under 10% threshold. Market price appears efficient at 67.6% for T1.",
