While Vitality holds 5-1 H2H advantage in 2025, Spirit's current tournament form is exceptional and this is essentially a coin flip match that market prices at 47% for Spirit - creating value.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 61%\nMarket Price: 49%\nEdge: +12% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Positive (~0.24 units on OVER)\nReasoning: Multiple expert sources (Bleacher Nation, Bet365) recommend the over citing both teams' fast-paced play and high-scoring tendencies.
