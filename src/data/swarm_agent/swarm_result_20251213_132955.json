Between January and November, global temperatures averaged 1.48\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, matching 2023's anomaly. This trend indicates a three-year period (2023\u20132025) where average global temperatures have exceeded the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement.

This milestone underscores the accelerating pace of climate change, driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) indicates that 2025 is on track to be one of the warmest years on record, likely the second or third warmest. Given the consistent rise in global temperatures and the surpassing of the 1.5\u00b0C threshold in recent years, it is reasonable to predict that 2025 could indeed be the second hottest year on record.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The Union Progressiste pour le Renouveau (UP-R) has strengthened its political position through a merger with the Parti Renaissance Nationale and is effectively preparing for the 2026 elections by organizing primaries. This consolidation and strategic planning likely enhance its chances of winning the most seats.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Given the current NVIDIA stock price of $185.32 and forecasts suggesting significant growth, it is unlikely that the stock will fall to $145 before 2026. Despite recent volatility in the AI sector, the projected demand for NVIDIA's products and higher analyst forecasts suggest the price will remain well above $145.",
