  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's price is a severe mispricing, with all models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to Bayern Munich being the heavy favorite. For Markets 2 and 3, there is unanimous agreement that no \"YES\" trade meets the 10% edge threshold, though models disagree on the precise probability for the Hannover match. Overall, the only actionable trade with a significant perceived edge is betting against Mainz 05 in Market 1.",
