Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for greater team effort and attention to detail to break the slump. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/bulls-hornets-set-meet-after-working-fix-flaws--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Charlotte Hornets:** The Hornets have lost three of their last four games, including a 115-106 defeat to the Denver Nuggets. Coach Charles Lee noted the benefit of rest following a busy stretch of six games in ten days.

([kabutoking.online](https://kabutoking.online/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn early December, Kabuto King auctioned a signed first-edition Kabuto card, with all proceeds benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The auction concluded with a winning bid of $51,100, highlighting the card's rising value and collector interest. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-auction-autographed-card-154500572.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven this upward trend, it's plausible that the first-edition Kabuto card could reach or exceed $100 by December 31, 2025. However, the market for collectible cards is volatile, and future prices will depend on factors such as the collector's contin\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?\nCurrent Market Price: 81.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $800.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-january\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the Federal Reserve has recently reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. This decision aligns with the Fed's cautious approach to monetary policy, considering ongoing inflation concerns and mixed economic indicators. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-signals-pause-rate-cuts-investors-navigate-data-darkness-leadership-change-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nLooking ahead, the Fed's projections indicate a potential for further rate cuts in 2026. Specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates one more 25 basis point reduction in 2026, consistent with their September outlook. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/brokerages-stick-with-us-rate-cut-forecasts-despite-fed-caution-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nMarket expectations reflect this outlook.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no clear betting edge in Market 1, as analysts' probability estimates vary widely from 45% to 60% against a market price of 58%. For Market 2, there is sharp disagreement, with some models seeing a strong \"YES\" edge and others a strong \"NO\" edge, reflecting high uncertainty in the card's volatile price trajectory. Regarding Market 3, analysts uniformly agree the \"NO\" side holds value, judging the 81% market price for a Fed rate cut as too high compared to their lower probability assessments.",

Hornets are at home and had rest after a busy stretch. While both teams are struggling, the Bulls' momentum is significantly worse, and home court advantage typically adds 3-4%. The market seems to slightly overvalue the Bulls here, but not by enough to trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Kabuto 1st Edition card hit $100 by December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -15% (25% - 40%)\nExpected Value: -15% \u00d7 1.5 = -22.5% (favorable NO bet)\nReasoning: While Kabuto King has driven impressive gains from $1 to ~$28, reaching $100 requires a 3.5x increase in just ~3 weeks. The market is driven by one collector's buying spree, which creates artificial demand that can collapse. The charity auction price ($51,100 for a signed card) doesn't reflect regular market prices. Collectible card markets are extremely volatile, and this type of speculative bubble rarely sustains exponential growth.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after January 2026 meeting?**\n\nYour Probability: 18%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -63% (18% - 81%)\nExpected Value: Massive edge on NO\n\nWait - let me re-read this. The context says \"20% probability\" in prediction markets and Fed projects only ONE more cut in 2026 (not January specifically). The Fed just cut rates and signaled a PAUSE. The market at 81% YES seems inconsistent with the news showing Fed caution.\n\nYour Probability: 20%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -61%\nReasoning: The news explicitly states Fed is signaling a pause, and prediction markets show only 20% probability of a January cut. The 81% price appears to be a data error or the market is severely mispriced. Fed projections suggest cuts later in 2026, not immediately in January.\n\n**Decision: NO**",

Hornets rested after tough stretch and playing at home. Market overvaluing Bulls name recognition despite terrible form. The 58% price doesn't reflect Bulls' current collapse.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Kabuto 1st Edition Card Hits $100 by Dec 31\n**Your Probability:** 15%\n**Market Price:** 40%\n**Edge:** -25% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive on NO side\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Card jumped from $1 to $28 due to artificial scarcity from one collector's manipulation. The $51,100 auction was for a SIGNED special card, not regular first editions. Market at $28 needs 257% gain in 19 days to hit $100 - extremely unlikely without continued artificial pumping. This is a classic pump scenario that market is overpricing.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Fed Decreases Rates 25bps After January 2026 Meeting\n**Your Probability:** 25%\n**Market Price:** 81%\n**Edge:** -56% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Massive positive on NO side\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Fed JUST cut 25bps to 3.5-3.75% on Dec 12, 2025. Their own projections show only ONE more 25bp cut for ALL of 2026, not specifically January. With inflation concerns persisting and recent cut just implemented, January 2026 (only 1 month away) is far too soon for another cut. Market is severely mispricing the timeline - Fed typically spaces cuts apart. This should be closer to 20-25% probability, not 81%.",
