Covering -1.5 in NHL is always difficult as games are often decided by 1 goal. The 33% price is reasonable for a puck line spread.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 90%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +12.2%\nExpected Value: ~12.2% \u00d7 0.29 = +3.5% ROI\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 globally vs Pipsqueak+4 at #25, with better recent form (6-4 vs 4-6).

No away team in this matchup scenario should be 92.8% favorites. The true probability of a Braunschweig win is likely around 25-35%. This is a strong NO bet.",
