The 85.2% price shown appears to be a severe mispricing or data error - the actual market consensus strongly favors higher tweet counts.

Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 implied ~18% probability, but reaching semifinals with 4 teams left suggests roughly 25-35% chance. The market seems fairly priced for a semifinal contender.

The web search provided football context which isn't relevant. In CS2 majors, competitive matches between strong teams often go to 3 maps. However, without specific team matchup data, the 50/50 market price is reasonable. Edge is below threshold.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",

The 85.2% price is severely mispriced - this appears to be a thinly traded subsidiary market that hasn't updated to reflect actual tracking data showing Musk is on pace for 380+ tweets.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Would be strong NO, but the mispricing is so extreme it suggests potential market mechanics issues or data lag - avoid engagement)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +26.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +26% \u00d7 2.45x payout = +63.7% EV\n\n**Reasoning:** Team Spirit is IN THE GRAND FINAL (December 14), meaning they're guaranteed top 2 finish with 50% baseline probability.
