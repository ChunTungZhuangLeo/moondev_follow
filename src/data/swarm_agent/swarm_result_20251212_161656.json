In November 2025, Sentient initiated a pre-order for its native token, SENT, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. The pre-order commenced on November 10, 2025, and concluded on November 13, 2025, with distribution on the same day. Participation was facilitated through the Ethereum network, with a pre-sale price of $0.006 per token and a minimum participation amount of 0.01 ETH. ([sentientc.ai](https://www.sentientc.ai/token/index.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nPrior to this, in August 2025, Sentient launched the Sentient Dynamics Token (SDT) on the RealSimple Crypto Exchange (RSCX).

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts NO for Market 1 and YES for Market 2, as the central box office projection of ~$110 million falls outside the first range but inside the second. There is significant disagreement only on Market 3, where four AIs cite a confirmed token launch for YES, while one disputes the project's identity for NO. Overall, the predictions align closely with the provided news, showing high agreement on the Avatar markets but conflicting interpretation for the Sentient token launch.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: The projections for \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" range from $100 million to $130 million, centering around $110 million. This makes it more likely that the opening weekend box office will either fall below $112 million or above $123 million, rather than within the specified range of $112 million to $123 million.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The projections center around $110 million, which falls within the range of $101 million to $112 million. Given this central estimate and the fact that the market consensus gives this range a 28% chance, it seems plausible that the opening weekend box office could fall within this range.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Sentient has already initiated a pre-order for its native token, SENT, in November 2025, with the distribution occurring the same month. This indicates that they have effectively launched a token within 2025, supporting a \"Yes\" prediction for this market.",

This range captures the most likely outcome based on current tracking data, though the 28% market probability seems reasonable given the uncertainty.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The news mentions a \"Sentient\" token pre-order in November 2025, but this appears to be from a different project (sentientc.ai) than the Sentient AGI platform this market likely refers to. With only ~19 days left in 2025 and no confirmed token launch announcement from the main Sentient platform, a token launch seems unlikely.",
