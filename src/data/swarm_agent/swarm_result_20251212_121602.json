([bitget.com](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605058794?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, the prediction market platform Opinion estimated an 82.3% probability that Lighter's FDV would exceed $2 billion, a 51% chance of exceeding $4 billion, and a 27% chance of surpassing $6 billion.

In July 2025, he expressed support for Vice President J.D. Vance, stating, \"I think J.D. Vance would be a great nominee,\" while emphasizing his current focus on his diplomatic role.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for betting against Marco Rubio's 2028 election win due to his non-candidacy and support for another candidate. For the Lighter token market, opinions are split between seeing a mispriced \"Yes\" opportunity based on older data and a \"No\" bet based on recent collapsed sentiment. Regarding the Angers SCO match, most analysts see a slight to moderate edge for a home win, but it often falls near or below the 10% threshold for a clear trade recommendation.",

However, home wins in Ligue 1 typically hover around 45-50% even with favorable matchups.

The dramatic drop from 68% to 7.3% suggests sentiment has shifted significantly negative. Crypto token launches hitting $3B FDV immediately is rare and requires exceptional hype.

A 95.9% implied probability is completely disconnected from reality.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Extreme mispricing. The true probability is around 3-5%, making NO an exceptional value bet.",

The 49.9% price appears stale/mispriced.

The 95.9% price likely reflects confusion or a different market question - this edge is enormous.\n\n**CRITICAL NOTE ON MARKET 3:** The 95.9% price seems impossible given the context.

If the price is accurate as stated, this represents one of the largest mispricings possible - Rubio should be under 5% based on all available evidence.",
