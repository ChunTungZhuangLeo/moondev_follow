The over/under for the game is set at 231.5 points.\n\n**Recent Team Performance:**\n\n- **Detroit Pistons:** Leading the Eastern Conference with a 19-5 record, the Pistons have won four of their last five games. They are coming off a nearly week-long break, which coach J.B. Bickerstaff utilized to address turnovers, a persistent issue for the team averaging 15.2 per game.

Prediction markets have been actively assessing these expectations.\n\nOn November 12, 2025, the prediction market platform Opinion estimated an 82.3% probability that Lighter's FDV would exceed $20 billion on the day after its launch. Additionally, there was a 51% chance of surpassing $40 billion and a 27% chance of exceeding $60 billion. ([kucoin.com](https://www.kucoin.com/news/flash/market-predicts-82-3-chance-lighter-fdv-exceeds-20-billion?utm_source=openai))\n\nSimilarly, Polymarket data indicated a 72% probability that Lighter's FDV would exceed $1 billion on the day after its launch, with a 67% chance of surpassing $2 billion. The trading volume for this prediction market had surpassed $15.45 million at that time.

Founder and CEO Vladimir Novakovski has indicated that the ongoing Season 2 points farming campaign will conclude prior to the year's end, though not as late as December 31. ([bitgetapp.com](https://www.bitgetapp.com/academy/lighter-tge-date-set-on-christmas-farm-points-guide?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe community has responded positively to these developments. A prediction market on Polymarket shows an 80% probability that Lighter will perform an airdrop by December 31, 2025. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/market/will-lighter-perform-an-airdrop-by-december-31?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, prominent whale traders have collectively placed a $150,000 bet on the airdrop occurring before the end of the year.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends a YES trade on Market 3 due to a massive, agreed-upon edge from founder statements and other prediction markets. For Market 2, most analysts recommend YES, seeing the current price as undervalued compared to earlier high-probability indicators. There is significant disagreement on Market 1, with no clear trade recommendation, as analysts' true probability estimates vary widely from 42% to 65%.",

Hawks did score 131 recently but against weak Washington. The Pistons' defensive focus and rest period suggests under is slightly more likely, but the edge isn't sufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$1B one day after launch?**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 78%\nMarket Price: 65.4%\nEdge: +12.6% (78% - 65.4%)\nExpected Value: ~12.6% \u00d7 0.53 = 6.7% return\nReasoning: Earlier prediction market data from November showed 72% probability for >$1B and 67% for >$2B, with Opinion showing 82.3% chance of exceeding $20B. The current 65.4% price appears to undervalue this given the strong market sentiment, whale interest, and the fact that $1B is a relatively low bar compared to higher FDV predictions being priced.
