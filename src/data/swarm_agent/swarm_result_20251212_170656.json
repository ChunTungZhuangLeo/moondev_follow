  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1's price overvalues West Bromwich Albion, with most models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to poor form versus Sheffield United's unbeaten run. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement on the true probability, leading to split \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations, though all acknowledge the high market price. Regarding Market 3, most analysts agree on a \"YES\" trade for Barcelona, citing their improved form under a new coach as undervalued by the current market price.",
