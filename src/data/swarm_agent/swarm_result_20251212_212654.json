  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong disagreement on Market 1, with most AIs seeing the 95.8% price as too high but disagreeing on the true probability, leading to mixed trade signals. For Market 2, opinions are split between a \"YES\" bet with a perceived edge and a \"NO\" bet due to Leverkusen's inconsistency. Regarding Market 3, most analysts agree the 74% price for Crvena Zvezda is an overvaluation, though the edge is often calculated as below the 10% threshold for a recommended trade.",

However, by Dec 16 (the target date), we're looking at week 3-4 post-release when viewership typically continues declining. The 95.8% market price seems slightly high for a show in its third week, but not enough edge to justify a NO bet given Netflix's lack of strong competition and ST5's remaining momentum.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13% edge \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Leverkusen is playing at home (BayArena) against FC K\u00f6ln in a Rhein derby. Despite the Dec 6 loss to Augsburg, Leverkusen showed resilience with a late equalizer vs Newcastle on Dec 10. K\u00f6ln is historically weaker, and home advantage in this derby is significant. The market at 62% undervalues Leverkusen's home strength and quality advantage over a struggling K\u00f6ln side.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (on Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: +11.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+11% edge \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has dominated this rivalry recently with 23 consecutive home wins in Adriatic League and tight victories in recent EuroLeague matchups (89-84 in Dec 2024, 73-71 in Jan 2025). While this game is at Partizan's arena, Zvezda's recent form and psychological edge in the Belgrade derby suggests the market is undervaluing their chances at 74%.
