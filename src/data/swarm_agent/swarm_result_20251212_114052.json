Vance would be a great nominee.\" ([aol.com](https://www.aol.com/rubio-2028-election-think-jd-143236894.html?utm_source=openai)) Rubio also acknowledged Vance as the leading contender for the Republican nomination, expressing his intention to support Vance if he chooses to run. ([newsmax.com](https://www.newsmax.com/politics/marco-rubio-jd-vance-gop/2025/11/07/id/1233629/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn October 2025, President Donald Trump suggested that a ticket composed of Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be \"unstoppable\" in the 2028 presidential elections, highlighting their capabilities and solidifying his influence within the Republican Party.

The 49.9% market price appears to significantly undervalue the likelihood based on aggregated market sentiment and comparable crypto launches.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -87.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Exceptional (87.9% \u00d7 ~25x payout on NO = massive EV)\nReasoning: This market is severely mispriced. Rubio has explicitly stated support for J.D. Vance for 2028 and called Vance the \"leading contender.\" A 95.9% probability for someone who hasn't declared candidacy and is actively supporting a different candidate is absurd.

While Angers has decent home form and Nantes is struggling, the market at 55% significantly overvalues Angers' chances compared to professional bookmaker odds. Home wins in Ligue 1 for mid-table teams against relegation-threatened opponents typically hover around 40-45%.\n\nDecision: NO\n\nMARKET 2: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$3B one day after launch?\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: +0.1% (50% - 49.9%)\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: The search results mention 68% probability from a different snapshot, but current market shows 49.9%. Crypto token launches are highly speculative with extreme volatility. Without knowing launch date, tokenomics, or market conditions, this is essentially a coin flip with no reliable edge available.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\nMARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -87.9% (8% - 95.9%)\nExpected Value: Massive positive EV on NO\nReasoning: This market price is clearly erroneous or manipulated. Rubio has explicitly endorsed JD Vance for 2028 and hasn't declared candidacy. Vance is the presumptive GOP frontrunner as sitting VP. Even if Rubio ran, winning the presidency from this position would be extremely unlikely. The 95.9% price makes no logical sense given available evidence.\n\nDecision: NO",
