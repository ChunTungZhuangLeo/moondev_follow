([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/soccer/liverpool-fc-vs-brighton-hove-albion-prediction-odds-picks-dec-13?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **Brighton & Hove Albion:** In their last match on December 7, 2025, Brighton secured a 1-1 draw against West Ham United, with Georginio Rutter scoring a stoppage-time equalizer. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/740740?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Liverpool FC:** Liverpool is currently 10th in the Premier League, with a record of 7 wins, 2 draws, and 6 losses.

The latest data shows that THEO is trading at $0.00288 per token.\n\nIn the absence of an official launch, prediction markets on platforms like Polymarket have been established to speculate on Theo's potential FDV post-launch. These markets offer various outcomes, including scenarios where Theo's FDV surpasses $700 million one day after launch. However, without an actual launch, these markets remain speculative and lack real-world data to validate such valuations.\n\nGiven the current lack of official announcements or expert analyses regarding Theo's token launch and valuation, it's advisable to monitor official channels for updates and exercise caution when engaging with speculative markets. \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: 76ers vs. Hawks\nCurrent Market Price: 46.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on 76ers\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/nba-phi-atl-2025-12-14\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe Philadelphia 76ers and the Atlanta Hawks have recently faced each other in a thrilling double-overtime game on November 30, 2025, where the Hawks emerged victorious with a 142-134 win. In that matchup, Jalen Johnson led the Hawks with a career-high 41 points, 14 rebounds, and 7 assists, including two crucial three-pointers in the closing moments of double overtime. Tyrese Maxey was the standout for the 76ers, scoring 44 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds.

The 76ers are aiming to extend their current three-game road win streak. The Hawks have a balanced record of 14-11, with Jalen Johnson contributing significantly, averaging 4.4 fast break points per game. The 76ers, with a 14-10 record, are led by Andre Drummond, who averages 9.3 rebounds per game.

  "system_prompt": "You are a prediction market expert analyzing Polymarket markets.\nYou have been provided with RECENT NEWS AND CONTEXT for each market from web search.\n\nIMPORTANT: For each market, you MUST estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY of the outcome.\nCompare your probability estimate to the market price to find EDGE (mispricing).\n\nEdge = Your Probability - Market Probability\n- Positive edge on YES side means market undervalues YES\n- Negative edge means market overvalues YES (bet NO instead)\n\nFor each market, provide your prediction in this EXACT format:\n\nMARKET [number]: [decision]\nYour Probability: [0-100]%\nMarket Price: [shown price]%\nEdge: [+/-X]% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: [calculate: Edge \u00d7 potential payout]\nReasoning: [1-2 sentences explaining your probability estimate]\n\nDecision must be one of: YES, NO, or NO_TRADE\n- YES = Your probability > Market price + 10% (minimum 10% edge)\n- NO = Your probability < Market price - 10%\n- NO_TRADE = Edge < 10% (not enough value)\n\nBe contrarian when you have conviction.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's \"YES\" price is overvalued given Liverpool's home advantage and Brighton's injuries, and that Market 2 is highly speculative with a low true probability. Analysts disagree on Market 3, with a split between seeing a close matchup (no trade) and favoring the 76ers (YES trade) based on recent form. Overall, the only trade meeting the 10%+ edge threshold is a \"YES\" on the 76ers in Market 3, while \"NO\" positions are favored for the first two markets.",
