Consequently, the focus has shifted to potential successors within the Republican Party.\n\n**Vice President JD Vance** has emerged as a prominent figure in this context. In August 2025, President Trump referred to Vance as the \"most likely\" candidate to secure the 2028 Republican nomination, stating, \"Well, I think most likely. In all fairness, he's the vice-president.\" ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-06/donald-trump-jd-vance-likely-republican-nominee-us-election-2028/105622024?utm_source=openai)) Vance, who has served as Vice President since 2025 and previously as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, has expressed that he does not feel \"entitled\" to a presidential run in 2028, emphasizing the importance of consulting with President Trump before making such a decision.

([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/i/grok/share/BKwzICm9XkZbTHxcjv9seORNU?utm_source=openai)) This consistent posting pattern suggests that he is likely to tweet between 476 and 770 times from December 12 to December 19, 2025.\n\nPrediction markets reflect this expectation. For instance, a market on Polymarket regarding the number of tweets Musk will post during this period shows a 7% chance for the 200-219 tweet range, with the majority of trades favoring higher tweet counts. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19-0-19?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven Musk's established tweeting frequency and the market's consensus, it is highly probable that he will post more than 200 tweets between December 12 and December 19, 2025.\n\n\n## Elon Musk's Twitter Activity and Ma...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",
