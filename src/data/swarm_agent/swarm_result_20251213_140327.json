  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's \"NO\" (Bristol City losing) as a clear opportunity, with all models agreeing the market's 83% price for a Bristol win vastly overestimates their true probability against the league leaders. For Market 3, opinions diverge, with one model seeing a 14% edge for CSUN while another finds no actionable trade, indicating higher uncertainty. There is general agreement that Market 2's high probability for a draw is overvalued, though the estimated edge varies.",
