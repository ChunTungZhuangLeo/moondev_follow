For Markets 1 and 2, most AIs see the prices as reasonably efficient, resulting in a \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation due to insufficient edge. The primary disagreement lies in Market 1, where one AI sees a 12% edge for \"YES\" against the others' view of a minimal or negative edge.",

Chicago is weak but -1.5 spread is difficult in divisional matchups. Edge too small to justify trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +2.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low (~$0.05 per $1 wagered)\nReasoning: Heroic (#9 ranking, 6-4 recent form) should beat Pipsqueak+4 (#25 ranking, 4-6 form) in Game 1, and 97% community prediction supports this. However, market price already reflects this advantage with insufficient edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -47.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +$1.08 per $1 wagered on NO\nReasoning: **MAJOR MISPRICING DETECTED.** Braunschweig (14th place, 2-1-7 in last 10) faces Dresden (17th place) in an away match between two struggling teams. The 92.8% price assumes near-certainty, but Braunschweig's terrible recent form (20% win rate) and away disadvantage makes this closer to a coin flip. The market appears to have misread this as a strong favorite scenario when both teams are bottom-table strugglers. **Strong NO recommendation - bet against Braunschweig winning.**",

Covering -1.5 in NHL is always challenging (~30-35% historical rate for favorites). The 33% price is reasonably accurate.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -2.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge on either side\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 Pipsqueak+4, with better recent form (6-4 vs 4-6). However, 97% community prediction suggests possible overconfidence. Game 1 of a BO3 can be volatile, and upsets happen. The 77.8% price fairly reflects Heroic's advantage while accounting for variance.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\nYour Probability: 30%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -62.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: MASSIVE edge on NO - potential ~8.5x return on NO bet\nReasoning: This market price is ABSURD. Braunschweig is 14th in 2. Bundesliga with 2 wins in last 10 games, playing AWAY at Dynamo Dresden. Even struggling away teams rarely have >90% win probability. Dresden at home should be slight favorites or it's a coin flip. The 92.8% YES price is wildly mispriced - likely a market error or manipulation.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n| Market | Decision | Edge |\n|--------|----------|------|\n| 1 | NO_TRADE | +2% |\n| 2 | NO_TRADE | -2.8% |\n| 3 | **NO** | **-62.8%** |",
