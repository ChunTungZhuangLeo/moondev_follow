For instance, a Polymarket event showed an 85% chance of Trump being included in the shortlist.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on Market 2, as all AIs agree Trump's inclusion is impossible after Time's announcement, creating a massive edge. For Market 1, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" but all agree LGD is favored, with no clear 10%+ edge consensus. On Market 3, most see Sabalenka as overvalued, but estimates of a sufficient edge for a \"NO\" bet vary.",

If no shortlist has been publicly released by now, it's extremely unlikely one will be published, making Trump's inclusion nearly impossible.

Trump was heavily favored in predictions, and given his political prominence as president-elect/president, he almost certainly would have been on any shortlist.
