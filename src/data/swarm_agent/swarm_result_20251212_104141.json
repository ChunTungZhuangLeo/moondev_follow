  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 3's 95.9% price is a severe overvaluation, with all AIs recommending a \"NO\" trade due to Rubio's low candidacy likelihood. For Market 2, opinions are split between \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" though those recommending a trade agree there is a positive edge based on Lighter's strong metrics. Regarding Market 1, most analyses conclude there is insufficient edge versus the 55% market price, leading to a prevalent \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation.",

While Angers has decent home form and Nantes is struggling, a home win in Ligue 1 against any opponent typically has 40-45% probability.

Doubling valuation to $3B FDV on launch is plausible given hype and airdrop allocation. However, crypto launches are volatile and the edge is below threshold.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -87.9% (8% - 95.9%)\nExpected Value: Massive positive EV on NO\nReasoning: This market price appears to be an error or extreme mispricing. Rubio has endorsed JD Vance, hasn't declared candidacy, and the 2028 election is 3 years away with many potential candidates. No candidate should be at 95.9% this far out. The recent $757 trade on NO suggests others see this mispricing.\n\nDecision: NO",
