  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear mispricing in Market 2, with most AIs agreeing the \"YES\" probability is vastly overvalued at 97.1% and recommending a \"NO\" trade. For Markets 1 and 3, the AIs generally agree there is no actionable edge, as their estimated probabilities are too close to the market prices to meet the 10% threshold. Notably, there is minor disagreement on the exact probabilities for these sports events, but unanimous agreement that they do not present a high-conviction trading opportunity.",

Home advantage and opponent's poor form suggest slight edge, but recent 1-0 loss to Alav\u00e9s shows inconsistency.

A jump from $2B to $10B is extremely unlikely. The 97.1% price appears to be a misread - this is likely showing NO probability.

However, their recent 1-0 loss to Alav\u00e9s and inconsistent season suggests the market is fairly priced. Home advantage gives slight edge but not enough conviction.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only -1%, well below the 10% threshold needed.\n\n---\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -94.1% (3 - 97.1)\nExpected Value: Very high for NO side\n\nWait, I need to re-read this. The market is at 97.1% YES, but the search shows it's actually trading at 2.1% YES. There's a data discrepancy. The web search indicates the market is at 2.1% YES (meaning 97.9% NO), and related markets show $1B at 72% and $2B at 82.3%. A $10B FDV is extremely unlikely for a new crypto project launch.\n\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -95.1%\nReasoning: The market price shown (97.1% YES) appears to be an error or the market has shifted. Based on web context showing 2.1% YES probability, achieving $10B FDV one day after launch is extraordinarily rare. Even the most hyped launches rarely hit this threshold immediately.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Data discrepancy makes this unreliable to trade.\n\n---\n\nMARKET 3: YES (Thunder)\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 81.0%\nEdge: +4% (85 - 81)\nExpected Value: 4% \u00d7 ~0.23 payout = ~0.9%\nReasoning: Thunder are 24-1 with a 16-game win streak and historically dominant form. They demolished Phoenix 138-89. Against the Spurs in a neutral semifinal, their elite roster depth and momentum strongly favor them. However, NBA Cup games can be unpredictable.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only +4%, below the 10% threshold.
