Both teams have demonstrated a tendency to score in recent matches, making the \"Both Teams to Score\" (BTTS) market particularly relevant for this fixture.\n\n**Recent Form and Head-to-Head Record:**\n\n- **Leicester City FC:** In their last six league games, Leicester has achieved three wins, one draw, and two losses, averaging 1.83 goals scored and 1.83 conceded per match.

The forecast for the remainder of the day indicates temperatures will remain in the upper 30s to low 40s, with no significant increase expected.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting NO on the NYC temperature market due to a massive 80%+ edge against its improbable forecast, while also agreeing on betting YES for the Dota 2 match given Heroic's consistent edge. Analysts disagree on the football market, with most seeing insufficient edge for a trade despite shared skepticism of the high market price. Overall, two trades meet the 10%+ threshold: a high-conviction NO on Market 2 and a YES on Market 3.",

However, edge is insufficient for NO bet.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE - Edge below 10% threshold\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 5%\n**Market Price:** 86.0%\n**Edge:** -81.0% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Very High (81% edge \u00d7 payout)\n**Reasoning:** Current high is 40\u00b0F with hourly forecast showing temperatures declining to mid-30s for remainder of day.

Historical BTTS rates in English football hover around 50-60%. Ipswich has only conceded 0.5 goals per match in recent form (very defensive), making a clean sheet plausible. Leicester averaging 1.83 goals conceded suggests they can be scored on, but Ipswich's low scoring (1.33) creates real risk of them not scoring.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will the highest temperature in New York City be between 42-43\u00b0F on December 13?**\n\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -83%\nExpected Value: Extremely high on NO side\n\nReasoning: The hourly forecast shows temperatures peaking at 40\u00b0F at 3PM and declining thereafter. Current high is 40\u00b0F. For temperature to reach 42-43\u00b0F would require a 2-3\u00b0F jump that contradicts all forecast data.

Community predictions favor Heroic at 69%. Betting odds showing Aurora favored (1.68) contradicts recent results. The market at 52% significantly undervalues Heroic's demonstrated superiority in this matchup.\n\n**Decision: YES (on Heroic)**",
