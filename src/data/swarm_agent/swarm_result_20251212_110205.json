Given the recent form of both teams, the outcome is uncertain, and the current trade amount on the Wild suggests the market is somewhat balanced. This makes it difficult to confidently predict the outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite the introduction of a revised peace plan by Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. to reach an agreement, significant disagreements remain, particularly over territorial issues. With the market trading at a 22.5% probability for a ceasefire by March 31, 2026, and no major breakthroughs reported, a ceasefire by the given date seems unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Team Spirit is in strong form, having won 4 of their last 5 matches and holding a higher world ranking compared to Team Liquid. Additionally, they have a better head-to-head record against Team Liquid. The recent market trade favoring Team Liquid provides an opportunity to bet on Team Spirit given their current performance and rankings.",
