However, several incidents in recent years have raised questions about his use of racially insensitive language:\n\n- **May 2024**: Bill Pruitt, a former producer of \"The Apprentice,\" alleged that Trump used the N-word to describe Black contestant Kwame Jackson during the show's first season in 2004. Trump has consistently denied these allegations.

Trump's campaign spokesperson dismissed these claims as \"completely fabricated.\" ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/07/24/trumps-nephew-reportedly-claims-he-used-the-n-w...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will the Court Force Trump to Refund Tariffs?\nRecent trade: $1,569.81 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-the-court-force-trump-to-refund-tariffs\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court is deliberating on the legality of tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Court's decision could significantly impact the U.S. economy, potentially leading to substantial refunds to businesses that have paid these tariffs.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Legal Challenges:** Major companies, including Costco, Revlon, and Kawasaki Motors, have filed lawsuits against the U.S. government to secure refunds for tariffs paid under the contested IEEPA-based tariffs. These actions underscore the widespread concern among importers regarding the legality of the tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding potential refunds.

The film set a new record for the highest Memorial Day weekend opening, grossing $183 million over the four-day period, surpassing the previous record held by \"Top Gun: Maverick\" at $160 million.

For Market 3, most responses predict \"NO,\" as the film's record-breaking opening contradicts a third-place finish, though one dissenting \"YES\" vote and two \"NO_TRADE\" calls indicate some ambiguity in interpreting the market's question.",

Without clear indications of how the Supreme Court might rule, taking a position on this market is speculative.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: \"Lilo & Stitch\" is reported to be the highest-grossing film of 2025, which implies that it would not have the third-best opening but rather one of the top two. Therefore, it is unlikely that it will be ranked third in terms of opening weekend performance.",

With less than 3 weeks remaining in December and no incidents reported, this is highly unlikely to occur publicly.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While the Supreme Court is reviewing IEEPA tariff legality, courts forcing refunds would be an extraordinary remedy requiring both a ruling against Trump AND a specific refund order. Even if the Court rules against the tariffs, refund mandates are procedurally complex and unlikely within this market's timeframe.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The news indicates Lilo & Stitch had a $183 million 4-day Memorial Day opening, making it the highest-grossing film of 2025. This suggests it likely had the BEST or second-best opening weekend, not third best. The market asks specifically about \"third best,\" which appears inconsistent with its record-breaking performance.",
