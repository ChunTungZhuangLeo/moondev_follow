Sheffield United, on the other hand, has been in better form with four wins in their last five matches. This suggests that the market may be overestimating West Brom's chances of winning.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 96.0%\nEdge: -16% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -$16 (if betting $100)\nReasoning: Although President Trump has announced plans for a \"Board of Peace,\" the actual establishment of such a body by the end of 2025 seems unlikely given the complexities involved and the expected unveiling in early 2026. The high market probability suggests overconfidence in the immediate formation of this board.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 54.3%\nEdge: +15.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +$15.7 (if betting $100)\nReasoning: FC Barcelona has shown significant improvement under their new coach, winning seven out of eight recent games.

Despite West Brom having home advantage, the form differential strongly favors Sheffield United, making a West Brom win unlikely at 60%.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -4%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Trump has announced plans but the Board of Peace is expected to be \"unveiled in early 2026\" according to Reuters. The market asks about establishment \"in 2025\" - with only ~19 days left in 2025 and the announcement pointing to 2026, there's meaningful risk this doesn't happen in 2025. However, the edge isn't quite 10% to justify a NO bet.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 58%\nMarket Price: 54.3%\nEdge: +3.7%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Barcelona is playing at home (Palau Blaugrana) and has been in excellent form under new coach Xavi Pascual (7 wins in 8 games). While Olympiacos added Monte Morris to strengthen their roster, home court advantage and Barcelona's recent resurgence give them a slight edge. However, the 3.7% edge is insufficient to justify a trade.",

However, home advantage at The Hawthorns provides West Brom some value. The 15% edge favors NO but I require clearer conviction for Championship matches given their volatility.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -81% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Very High (massive mispricing)\nReasoning: The market is confusing \"announced plans\" with actual establishment. Trump announced plans to unveil the board in EARLY 2026, not 2025. The question asks if he will \"establish\" it in 2025, which appears impossible given we're already in mid-December 2025 and the unveiling is scheduled for 2026. This is a clear NO bet with enormous edge.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 54.3%\nEdge: +13.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (13.7% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: Barcelona's dramatic turnaround under Xavi Pascual (7 wins in 8 games) combined with home court advantage at Palau Blaugrana creates significant value. While Olympiacos added Monte Morris, Barcelona's momentum and home venue in EuroLeague basketball provides a substantial edge over the market's near-coinflip pricing.",
