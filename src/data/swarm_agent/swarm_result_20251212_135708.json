  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a potential edge favoring BIG in the CS:GO match, with three AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade due to its superior ranking and form versus the market price, though two others found the edge insufficient. For the other markets, analysts broadly agree there is no clear 10%+ edge on the NBA over/under, and they generally view the high market probability of an Israel strike as overvalued based on de-escalation reports. Overall, only the BIG vs. Sangal market shows notable actionable disagreement among the models.",

Hawks just scored 131 in their last game and are 14-11. Both teams have offensive capability, and 233.5 is a moderately high total. The 58% probability for OVER reflects strong offensive rosters, but the 9% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold for a confident trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Counter-Strike BIG vs Sangal (BO3)\n\n**Your Probability:** 55%\n**Market Price:** 48%\n**Edge:** +7% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Positive but below threshold\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n**Reasoning:** BIG has superior recent form (8-2 vs 7-3 last 10 matches) and leads head-to-head 2-1. BIG is ranked #53 vs Sangal's #59. However, both teams are closely matched in the rankings, and in BO3 format, variance is high. The 7% edge is insufficient for a confident trade given the competitive nature and small ranking differential.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Will Israel strike Lebanon on December 13?\n\n**Your Probability:** 25%\n**Market Price:** 79.3%\n**Edge:** -54.3% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** STRONG NEGATIVE (bet NO)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Market is severely overpricing YES at 79.3%. Recent evidence shows clear de-escalation: IDF operations decreased significantly Dec 1-7, diplomatic engagement is increasing (Iranian FM visiting Beirut Dec 11), and there's no credible intelligence suggesting strikes planned for Dec 13 specifically. The ceasefire trend and diplomatic activity make a strike on this specific date unlikely (~25% probability accounting for unpredictable escalation). **This represents a massive 54% edge on the NO side - STRONG BET NO.**",
