  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Epstein or Maxwell confirmed Mossad operatives in 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,513.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/epstein-or-maxwell-confirmed-mossad-opperatives-in-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no confirmed evidence that Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell were operatives of the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad. In July 2025, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett categorically denied such allegations, describing them as \"a vicious wave of slander and lies\" against Israel. ([time.com](https://time.com/7302177/epstein-mossad-israel-intelligence-naftali-bennett/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite these denials, speculation persists. For instance, in August 2025, a conspiracy theory publication claimed that Maxwell's confession exposed a covert operation involving Mossad, the CIA, and DARPA to create programmable human clones. However, these claims lack credible evidence and are widely regarded as unfounded. ([operationdisclosureofficial.com](https://operationdisclosureofficial.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Restored-Republic-via-a-GCR-8-18-2025.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, in July 2025, a prediction market titled \"Epstein or Maxw\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Norway win the 2026 FIFA World Cup?\nCurrent Market Price: 96.4% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $4,640.99 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/2026-fifa-world-cup-winner-595\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nNorway has qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, marking their first appearance since 1998. Under the leadership of coach St\u00e5le Solbakken, the team achieved a perfect record in UEFA Group I, winning all eight matches. A standout performance was their 4-1 victory over Italy on November 16, 2025, where Erling Haaland scored twice, bringing his qualifying tally to 16 goals. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/norway-book-world-cup-spot-italy-are-forced-into-playoffs-2025-11-16/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe squad boasts a blend of experienced and emerging talents. Haaland's prolific scoring is complemented by the midfield prowess of Martin \u00d8degaard and the defensive stability provided by Kristoffer Ajer. Additionally, players like Antonio Nusa and Oscar Bobb have been instrumental in Norway's offensive strategies.

Former Israeli PM Bennett has categorically denied the allegations, and there's no credible evidence supporting Mossad connections.

The 62% seems slightly generous for Om\u00f3noia given Conference League competition levels, but edge is insufficient.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Edge of only ~4% is below the 10% threshold required for a trade)",

With only 18 days left in 2025, official confirmation from Mossad (a notoriously secretive agency) is extremely unlikely. The market correctly prices this at 97.2% NO.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE - Market is correctly priced. This is asking about YES at 2.8%, which would need to drop below -7.2% (impossible) for a NO trade to have edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 3%\n**Market Price:** 96.4%\n**Edge:** -93.4% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +93.4% (betting NO at 3.6 cents pays $1 if Norway doesn't win)\n**Reasoning:** While Norway qualified impressively with Haaland in form, they face elite competition from France, Brazil, Argentina, England, Spain, and Germany. Historical underdogs rarely win World Cups - Norway hasn't even made a quarterfinal since 1998. A 3% chance is generous given the field strength.\n\n**Decision:** NO - Massive edge betting against Norway. Market severely underestimates the difficulty of winning a World Cup against traditional powerhouses.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Your Probability:** 45%\n**Market Price:** 62.0%\n**Edge:** -17% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +17% (betting NO at 38 cents)\n**Reasoning:** Om\u00f3noia has strong recent form (3-0 and 2-0 wins), but Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa is a quality Polish side. Conference League matches are competitive, and 62% implies Om\u00f3noia should be clear favorites. Recent large NO trades ($2,821) suggest sharp money disagrees with the 62% pricing. Home advantage is real but not worth 62%.\n\n**Decision:** NO - Significant edge. Market overvalues Om\u00f3noia's chances based on recent domestic wins, but European competition is a different level. The 62% price should be closer to 45-50% for a home team against quality opposition.",
