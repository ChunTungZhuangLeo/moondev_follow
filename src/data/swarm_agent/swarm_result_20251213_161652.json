With both teams having similar low rankings and no head-to-head history, predicting the outcome is highly uncertain. \n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The recent trade indicates a preference for the Under, and given Elon's strong defensive performance in their last game (holding Wofford to 52 points), it suggests the game might not reach 158.5 points. Additionally, Northern Illinois is on a losing streak, which could further limit scoring.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite a statement from Indonesia's President about potentially normalizing relations with Israel if certain conditions are met, recent actions like blocking Israeli athletes indicate a continued strong opposition.
