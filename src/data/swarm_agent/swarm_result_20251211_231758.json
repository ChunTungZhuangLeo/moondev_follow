      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While *Death Stranding 2: On the Beach* has received favorable reviews and is a strong contender with industry recognition, the Steam Awards nominees and winners have not yet been announced. Without further information on the competition and given the significant betting on \"No,\" it's prudent to avoid taking a position.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Both the Red Wings and Oilers have been involved in high-scoring games recently, with their last matches ending in scores of 4-3. The presence of high-caliber offensive players like Alex DeBrincat and Connor McDavid suggests a potential for a high-scoring game, supporting the \"Over\" bet on 6.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both the Bulls and the Hornets are struggling, with significant losing streaks and recent poor performances. While the Hornets might have a slight edge playing at home, the unpredictability of two struggling teams makes it difficult to confidently predict an outcome, warranting a \"No Trade\" decision.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: Despite the market's current low probability for a 'Yes' outcome ($965 on No), Death Stranding 2 has received strong critical acclaim (Metacritic 89) and multiple industry recognitions, including a Game of the Year nomination at The Game Awards 2025, suggesting a higher chance of winning the Steam Award than the market currently implies.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both the Red Wings and Oilers have been involved in high-scoring games recently, with their last respective matches both totaling 7 goals. This trend, coupled with key players performing well, indicates a strong likelihood for the total goals to exceed 6.5.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The Chicago Bulls are in a severe slump, having lost seven consecutive games and recently recording their lowest offensive output of the season. While the Hornets are also struggling, their home advantage and the Bulls' poor form make the Hornets the more favorable outcome, aligning with the market's current lean.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: While Death Stranding 2 has strong reviews (89 Metacritic), the Steam Awards are voted by the Steam community and historically favor different types of games. The $965 trade on No and competition from other 2025 titles make this a risky bet for DS2 winning specifically.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER\nReasoning: Both teams have shown offensive capability recently - Red Wings scored 4 against Calgary, Oilers scored 4 against Buffalo with McDavid hot. Edmonton games tend to be high-scoring, and both teams have shown defensive vulnerabilities that could push this over 6.5.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is a matchup between two struggling teams (Bulls on 7-game losing streak, Hornets lost 3 of 4), making it highly unpredictable. Without clear odds shown and both teams in poor form, there's no edge to identify in this volatile matchup.",

The recent $965 trade on No suggests informed betting against it.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The over/under at 6.5 is reasonable given both teams' recent scoring patterns, but the context shows mixed signals - Red Wings hot with 3 straight wins, Oilers coming off high-scoring OT loss. No clear edge on either side of the total.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite the recent $888.75 bet on Hornets, Chicago Bulls are the better team overall even during their 7-game skid. The Hornets are missing key players (LaMelo Ball, Tre Mann mentioned as questionable) and have been inconsistent, making the Bulls the safer pick on the road.",
