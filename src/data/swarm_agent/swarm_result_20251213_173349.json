Regarding Market 1, there is universal agreement to avoid trading, as the market's 95.9% price is deemed too high, though estimates of the true probability vary widely from 55% to 93%.",

However, Leicester's home form is inconsistent (1W-1D-1L), and the 95.9% market price already reflects the high likelihood. Insufficient edge to justify a NO position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Your Probability:** 15%\n**Market Price:** 86.0%\n**Edge:** -71% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive on NO side\n**Reasoning:** Weather data shows NYC high is approximately 40\u00b0F on Dec 13, with Winter Weather Advisory in effect and snow expected. Temperature is 2-3\u00b0F below the target range of 42-43\u00b0F.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -40.9%\nExpected Value: Very negative if betting YES at this price\nReasoning: The 95.9% market price is absurdly high for a BTTS market - typical BTTS odds in football are 50-65%. This appears to be a market anomaly or near resolution. Even with both teams in decent form, BTTS historically hits around 50-60% of the time in Championship matches. However, at 95.9%, the NO side would be the value play, but something seems off with this market pricing that suggests it may be near settlement or have unusual conditions.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -61%\nExpected Value: Very high betting NO (61% edge \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: The National Weather Service forecast explicitly states the high will be approximately 40\u00b0F, which is BELOW the 42-43\u00b0F range required. With a Winter Weather Advisory and cold temperatures confirmed, the high staying at 40\u00b0F means this market should resolve NO. The 86% YES price is massively mispriced given official forecasts show temps below the required range.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 52% (for Heroic)\nEdge: -4%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Heroic won their most recent matchup 2-0 at BLAST Slam IV, but Aurora has won 3 of last 5 historically. The market at 52% for Heroic seems reasonably priced given mixed recent results. Single game outcomes in Dota 2 are highly variable, and without current tournament context or roster information, there's no clear edge here. The $2,000 bet on Heroic moved the market but doesn't indicate clear value.",
