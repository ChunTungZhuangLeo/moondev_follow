  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's price as likely inverted or mislabeled, as all models estimate a very low true probability for an Osasuna win against dominant Barcelona. For Market 2, most agree the U.S. operation has already occurred, creating a significant positive edge for \"YES\" versus the current market price. There is notable disagreement on Market 3's probability, leading to no clear trading consensus for it.",

Osasuna winning this match is extremely unlikely (~8%), not 93%.

Osasuna is 15th place with only 2 points from last 6 games. Barcelona should win easily - Osasuna winning is ~5% at best. The 93% price appears to be for Barcelona winning, not Osasuna. This seems like a market labeling issue or I'm misunderstanding the question format.\n\n**CLARIFICATION NEEDED**: If 93% is actually the price for \"Osasuna to win,\" this is severely mispriced and would be a strong NO bet.
