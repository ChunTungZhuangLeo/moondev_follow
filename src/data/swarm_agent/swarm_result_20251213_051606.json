  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge to bet \"NO\" on NVIDIA being the second-largest company, as most AIs see the 83.4% market price as overconfident given its current #1 status and recent volatility. There is also clear agreement that the NHL game's \"Over 5.5 goals\" at a 49% market price presents a positive trading edge. However, for the PSG match, while all agree an \"Over\" is likely, the edge is deemed too small (typically under 10%) to warrant a recommended trade.",
