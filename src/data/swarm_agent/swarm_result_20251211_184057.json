      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The recent developments, such as Gavin Newsom's climate advocacy and the legal challenges, do not provide a clear indication of his chances of winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, making it difficult to make a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Given the recent form and statistics of BSC Young Boys, who have scored an average of 2.33 goals per game and conceded 2.17 goals per game in their last six matches, it is likely that the match will have over 1.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Although BSC Young Boys have been involved in high-scoring encounters, with an average of 2.67 goals scored and 0.67 conceded in their last three home games, the average goals per game in their Europa League matches is 3.8, which suggests that the match may not exceed 3.5 goals, especially considering Lille's relatively lower average of 3.2 goals per game.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite Gavin Newsom's active climate advocacy and national visibility, the legal challenges and significant budget deficit in California could negatively impact his political standing, making his nomination for the 2028 Democratic presidential candidacy less likely.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both BSC Young Boys and Lille OSC have shown strong scoring capabilities in recent matches, with Young Boys averaging over 2 goals per game and Lille having a similar record. This suggests a high probability of the match exceeding 1.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While BSC Young Boys and Lille OSC have been involved in high-scoring games, the line set at over 3.5 goals is quite high. The recent average goals per game for both teams suggest that while scoring is likely, surpassing 3.5 goals may not be as probable, making the under bet more appealing.",

      "response": "Based on the news context and market analysis, here are my predictions:\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\nReasoning: At only ~3% implied probability based on recent trading, Newsom faces significant headwinds including California's $18B budget deficit, legal challenges, and a crowded 2028 field. While he's positioning himself on climate issues, there's no clear path to frontrunner status this far out.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES (Over 1.5 goals)**\nReasoning: With Young Boys averaging 2.33 goals scored and 2.17 conceded per game, and their Europa League matches averaging 3.8 goals total, Over 1.5 is highly likely. The bookmaker odds of 1.14 for Over 1.5 confirm this is a near-certainty (~88% implied probability).\n\n**MARKET 3: NO (Under 3.5 goals)**\nReasoning: While Young Boys' Europa League average is 3.8 goals/game, this includes some outlier results. Lille is a quality opponent with better defensive discipline (only 6 conceded in 5 EL matches), making Under 3.5 the safer play despite the recent high-scoring trend for Young Boys.",

The recent $3,285 bet on \"No\" suggests market skepticism, but three years of political developments make this too uncertain for a strong position.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER\nReasoning: Both teams average over 3 goals per game in Europa League (Young Boys 3.8, Lille 3.2), and Young Boys average 4.5 goals combined in recent home matches. The odds heavily favor Over 1.5 (1.14 vs 5.00), and the statistical trends strongly support at least 2 goals in this match.\n\nMARKET 3: OVER\nReasoning: Young Boys' Europa League matches average 3.8 total goals, and Lille's average 3.2 goals per game. Young Boys at home have been in high-scoring encounters (2.67 scored, though only 0.67 conceded recently), and both teams' offensive capabilities suggest this match likely exceeds 3.5 total goals.",
