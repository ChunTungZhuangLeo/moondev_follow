  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2's \"YES\" price of 97.1% is a severe overvaluation, with most AIs recommending a \"NO\" trade due to a massive perceived edge. For Market 1, opinions on the true probability vary (52%-68%), leading to mixed trade signals and no clear 10%+ edge agreement. Regarding Market 3, while most acknowledge the Thunder as favorites, the calculated edges are consistently below the 10% threshold, resulting in a consensus of \"NO_TRADE.\"",

Historical La Liga home win rates for mid-table teams against relegation-threatened sides typically hover around 50-55%.

Earlier estimates showed 68% for >$3B and only 51% for >$4B. Reaching $10B would be extraordinary for a new DeFi protocol launch.

However, playoff/tournament settings can produce upsets, and Spurs showed strong form beating Lakers.
