  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows clear agreement on Markets 2 and 3, with both recommending a \"NO\" bet against the overvalued Over 1.5 goals and a \"YES\" bet on the undervalued Over 2.5 goals, respectively. For Market 1, opinions are split between a \"NO\" bet and declaring \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient context, highlighting a key disagreement on acting without specific event details. Overall, the actionable summary is to avoid Market 1, bet against the high probability in Market 2, and bet on the Over in Market 3 where a significant edge is identified.",
