Additionally, the recent trade activity on Polymarket heavily favors the \"No\" outcome, suggesting low probability for Mamdani's inclusion.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Andrew Tate is making his professional boxing debut, his background as a former kickboxing world champion and Chase DeMoor's recent trade activity makes it difficult to confidently predict the outcome. Without clear indicators favoring one fighter, taking a position is too speculative.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The Toronto Maple Leafs have shown more consistent performance recently compared to the San Jose Sharks, who have had a mixed record with a recent loss.
