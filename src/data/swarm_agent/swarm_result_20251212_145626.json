The 76ers are favored by 6.5 points in this matchup. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** The team has a 13-10 record, with a 5-5 record over their past 10 games. They have a 4-6 record against the spread during that span. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Pacers:** Holding a 6-18 record, the Pacers have won two straight games after a poor start to the season. Coach Rick Carlisle is on the verge of securing his 1,000th NBA win.

Applications opened on December 10, 2025, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reporting that 10,000 people had already pre-registered.

On Polymarket, a prediction market platform, the contract \"Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?\" is trading at 67% probability, suggesting a significant chance that no cards will be sold this year. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/will-trump-sell-0-gold-cards-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nExperts have raised concerns about the program's legality and potential economic impact.

However, recent developments suggest increasing international pressure and internal challenges that could influence his tenure.\n\n**U.S. Sanctions and Military Actions**\n\nOn December 11, 2025, the United States intensified its sanctions against Venezuela by targeting three nephews of First Lady Cilia Flores and imposing restrictions on six crude oil tankers. The U.S. Treasury accused these individuals and vessels of facilitating deceptive practices and supporting Maduro's administration, described as a \"corrupt narco-terrorist regime.\" This move coincided with a significant U.S. military buildup in the southern Caribbean, signaling a more assertive stance toward Venezuela.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus finds no clear betting edge for Market 1, with most AIs seeing it as roughly a coin flip. For Market 2, there is strong agreement that the \"YES\" price is drastically overvalued, recommending a \"NO\" bet due to the program's launch and pre-registrations. Opinions diverge sharply on Market 3, with no unified recommendation as assessments of political risk vary widely.",

The market price reflects a balanced view of the teams' capabilities, and the edge is not significant enough to warrant a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 70%  \nMarket Price: 87.0%  \nEdge: -17% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Negative (bet NO)  \nReasoning: Despite the skepticism around the Trump Gold Card program, 10,000 people have pre-registered, indicating potential sales. The market seems overly pessimistic, and the probability of at least some sales occurring in 2025 appears higher than the market price suggests.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 60%  \nMarket Price: 61.0%  \nEdge: -1% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Not applicable (less than 10% edge)  \nReasoning: While there is increasing international pressure on Maduro, no concrete actions or official confirmations suggest his imminent removal by March 31, 2026.

Pacers have won 2 straight and are playing better. Embiid's status is unclear (injury report cut off), and Maxey is dealing with illness. A 6.5 point spread is substantial given recent form, but edge is minimal.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -62%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The program launched December 10, 2025 with 10,000 pre-registrations reported by Commerce Secretary Lutnick. With 20+ days remaining in 2025 and significant pre-registration interest, it's highly likely at least ONE card will be sold/processed. The market at 87% for ZERO sales seems drastically mispriced given the program is now active and has substantial demand pipeline.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Bet that at least 1 card WILL be sold)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\nYour Probability: 20%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -41%\nExpected Value: High on NO side\nReasoning: Despite increased U.S. sanctions and military posturing, Maduro has survived far more intense pressure campaigns since 2019. He controls the military, judiciary, and security apparatus. There's no credible internal coup threat or viable opposition mechanism to remove him in ~3.5 months. The 61% probability vastly overestimates regime change likelihood in this timeframe.\n\n**Decision: NO**",

Pacers won 2 straight and are at home (wait, game is in Philly). With Embiid's injury status unclear and 76ers inconsistent ATS performance, this is essentially a coin flip.

The program officially launched December 10, 2025, with 10,000 pre-registrations already reported by Commerce Secretary Lutnick. With a $1M price point and thousands pre-registered, it's highly likely at least ONE card sells before year-end (only 19 days left).

He survived previous coup attempts and has military/Russian/Chinese backing. 55% chance he leaves by March 2026 is reasonable, but not enough edge versus 61% market price to justify a trade.",
