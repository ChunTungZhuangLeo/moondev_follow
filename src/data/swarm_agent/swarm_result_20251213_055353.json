This strong public endorsement, combined with support from influential figures like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, suggests a high probability that Warsh will be announced as the Fed Chair pick.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The recent performances of both teams show that the Oilers have momentum with a strong victory, while the Maple Leafs had a close overtime loss. Without clear information on injuries or other significant advantages for either team, it's challenging to make a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Hyperliquid is currently trading at approximately $29.35, and while there is volatility, the price is still above $20. Recent developments like the USDC integration could bolster the price, and unless the $30 support level fails significantly, a drop to $20 seems unlikely within the month.",

The Maple Leafs' recent loss was in overtime, not a dominant defeat, making the outcome too uncertain to take a strong position given the current market pricing.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Hyperliquid is currently trading at ~$29.35, and while analysts predict a potential dip to the $24-$26 range due to token unlocks, there is no news suggesting a more drastic drop all the way to $20.",
