Army's struggles on the road (1-3 record) further tilt the odds in favor of UMBC, making a \"No\" bet on Army more appealing.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: North Carolina A&T Aggies have a perfect home record (2-0) and face a Maryland Eastern Shore team struggling on the road (1-8) and on a three-game losing streak. With strong performance from key player Lewis Walker, betting \"Yes\" on North Carolina A&T to win seems advantageous.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: T1 has shown strong recent performance, winning four out of their last five games and maintaining a favorable head-to-head record against Dplus KIA. These factors, along with recent trades favoring T1, support a \"Yes\" bet on T1 to win the series.",
