The situation remains fluid, with ongoing military operations and contested claims from both Russian and Ukrainian sources.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Pokrovsk Offensive:** Russian forces have intensified operations in and around Pokrovsk, a strategic city in the Donbas region. On December 10, 2025, Ukrainian forces reported repelling a significant Russian mechanized assault in Pokrovsk, involving around 30 armored vehicles. Despite Russia's claims of full control over the city, Ukraine maintains that it holds the northern part, where intense urban combat continues.

([fdic.gov](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/in-brief/2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **The Santa Anna National Bank**: Closed on June 27, 2025, in Santa Anna, Texas, with about $63.8 million in assets and $53.8 million in deposits. ([fdic.gov](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/in-brief/2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese closures are relatively minor compared to previous years. For instance, in 2023, the U.S. experienced significant bank failures, including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.

Ford and accompanying warships. This buildup is officially aimed at countering drug trafficking but has raised concerns about potential escalation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_naval_deployment_in_the_Caribbean?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Venezuelan Response:** In reaction, Venezuela has mobilized nearly 200,000 troops for nationwide exercises, portraying the U.S. presence as a threat to its sovereignty.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly leans toward \"NO\" for Market 1, as most AIs find a Russian capture of Rodynske by December 31 unlikely given the fluid, contested frontline. For Market 2, there is a clear disagreement: two AIs cite the two 2025 bank failures as a definitive \"YES,\" while three argue those early-year, minor closures don't indicate a new imminent failure, favoring \"NO.\" Regarding Market 3, the majority predicts \"NO\" for a direct US-Venezuela military engagement, judging the significant troop deployments as posturing rather than a prelude to imminent conflict.",

The ongoing conflict and mixed reports make the outcome uncertain. Without definitive information, taking a position is speculative.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: With only two minor bank failures in 2025 and significant regulatory measures in place following the major bank failures of 2023, it seems unlikely there will be another U.S. bank failure by December 31. The recent trade also reflects a strong leaning towards \"No.\"\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela have increased, the deployment of U.S. forces is officially for countering drug trafficking, and there is no direct indication of imminent military engagement. The situation is volatile, but without specific evidence of direct conflict, the outcome remains uncertain.",

Recent news shows contested fighting continues but no breakthrough at this specific location.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The market asks if there will be a US bank failure by December 31, and the news confirms two bank failures have already occurred in 2025 (Pulaski Savings Bank in January and Santa Anna National Bank in June). This condition has already been met.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite significant military posturing with US naval deployment and Venezuelan troop mobilization, actual military engagement between nation-states is a high threshold that typically requires more direct provocation. The US deployment is framed as counter-narcotics operations, providing diplomatic cover to avoid direct confrontation within the next month.",

With 18 days left and no current banking crisis indicators, another failure by year-end is unlikely given the strengthened regulatory environment post-2023.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite significant military posturing (USS Gerald R. Ford deployment, Venezuelan exercises with 200,000 troops), these appear to be deterrence/counter-deterrence measures. Direct military engagement within 33 days would require a major incident, which neither side appears to be seeking despite heightened tensions.",
