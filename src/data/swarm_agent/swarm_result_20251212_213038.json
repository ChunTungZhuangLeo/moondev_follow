The Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging the legality of the tariffs in 2020, effectively allowing them to remain in place. Since then, there have been no significant legal developments regarding these tariffs.\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden maintained many of the tariffs imposed by the previous administration, citing national security concerns and the need to protect American industries. However, in 2022, the Biden administration began a process to review and potentially modify certain tariffs, aiming to ease trade tensions and reduce costs for American consumers. By 2023, some tariffs were reduced or eliminated, but many remained in place.\n\nAs of December 2025, the trade landscape has evolved, with ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China addressing various trade issues. While some tariffs have been adjusted, many remain, and the Supreme Cou...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

The Angers vs. Nantes market shows the most divergence, with a majority favoring \"YES\" for both teams to score, but one model dissented with \"NO_TRADE.\"",

Despite Nantes' defensive struggles, conceding an average of 2.17 goals per game, the likelihood of both teams scoring appears strong given their offensive stats.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The Philadelphia 76ers are favored by 6.5 points, but their recent narrow loss to the Lakers and Joel Embiid's offensive struggles create uncertainty. While the Pacers have improved with recent wins, the spread's margin makes predicting the outcome challenging without clearer performance trends.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: There have been no recent Supreme Court rulings in favor of Trump's tariffs, and the Court's previous decision was to decline hearing a case on them. With ongoing adjustments and negotiations around tariffs, a ruling in favor of Trump's tariffs seems unlikely at this time.",

Nantes have also been conceding heavily (2.17 goals/game), making BTTS likely in this Ligue 1 fixture.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite the $5,000 trade on 76ers -6.5, Joel Embiid's recent poor shooting (4-of-21) and the Pacers' improved form with two consecutive wins makes covering a 6.5-point spread risky. The 76ers are struggling to find rhythm.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The news indicates no recent Supreme Court rulings on Trump's tariffs, and the Court declined to hear a challenge in 2020.

A 6.5-point spread favoring Philadelphia seems too generous given their inconsistent play and Indiana's momentum.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The news context indicates no recent Supreme Court cases regarding Trump's tariffs as of December 2025, with the Court having declined to hear challenges in 2020. Without an active case before the Court, there is no mechanism for such a ruling to occur in the near term.",
