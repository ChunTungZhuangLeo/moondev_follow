Morant is listed as questionable for the upcoming game. The team's recent success is attributed to strong performances from 2024 draft picks:\n  - **Jaylen Wells** has averaged 16.7 points over the last nine games, contributing significantly to the team's defense.\n  - **Cam Spencer** has provided valuable bench production with 14.3 points and 5.3 assists per game.\n  - **Zach Edey** remains sidelined with a stress reaction in his left ankle and will be re-evaluated in four weeks.

However, Netanyahu faces ongoing political/legal pressure and Maduro's Venezuela remains volatile. The market is slightly overpricing stability, but not enough for a trade. Risk/reward doesn't justify the 3% edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 93%\nMarket Price: 89%\nEdge: +4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low positive but insufficient\nReasoning: Grizzlies winning 7 of last 9 games suggests high-scoring offense. Ja Morant potentially returning adds scoring power. Jazz have been poor defensively. Recent Grizzlies games have trended over, and both teams play uptempo. However, 4% edge is below our 10% threshold for recommendation.\n\n**DECISION: NO_TRADE** (Edge insufficient at 4%)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -14% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\n\nReasoning: Market is pricing Jazz at 56% to win first half, but Grizzlies have won 7 of last 9 games at home, while Jazz are struggling. Even without Morant (questionable), Grizzlies' depth with Wells and Spencer has been excellent. Memphis is significantly undervalued for first-half performance at home.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: Bet NO (Grizzlies 1H)** - Market overvalues Jazz by 14%, creating strong edge on Grizzlies side.",

Netanyahu faces ongoing legal/political pressure, Khamenei is elderly (85+), and geopolitical tensions persist. However, 18 days is a short window for regime change.

The Grizzlies are strong defensively lately with Wells contributing on that end. Ja Morant is questionable (could limit tempo if out), and Zach Edey is out. The Jazz are a rebuilding team with inconsistent offense. NBA totals typically hit around 50-55% rates, not 89%.

The Jazz are rebuilding with a 9-17 record. A 56% implied probability for the Jazz to win the first half at FedExForum seems significantly overpriced. Memphis should be favored, especially in the first half at home.\n\n**Decision: NO (bet Grizzlies 1H)**",
