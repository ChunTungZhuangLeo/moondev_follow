Recent analyses and expert opinions suggest that both teams are likely to score in this Championship fixture.\n\n**Recent Form and Head-to-Head Record:**\n\n- **Leicester City:** The Foxes have shown mixed form recently, with three wins, one draw, and two losses in their last six matches. They average 1.83 goals scored and 1.83 conceded per game during this period.

([americanwx.com](https://www.americanwx.com/bb/topic/62392-december-2025-obs-and-discussion/page/32/?utm_source=openai)) Historically, December 13 temperatures in New York City have varied. For instance, in 2015, Central Park reached a record high of 66\u00b0F, while the average high is typically around 38\u00b0F. ([newsmobile.in](https://www.newsmobile.in/world/new-york-warm-winter-weather-sets-record/?utm_source=openai)) In 1998, the highest recorded temperature for December 13 was 75\u00b0F. ([extremeweatherwatch.com](https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/new-york/month-december/highest-temperatures?utm_source=openai)) Therefore, while temperatures between 42-43\u00b0F are within the expected range for December 13, they are on the higher end of the historical spectrum. \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Dota 2: Heroic vs Aurora - Game 1 Winner\nCurrent Market Price: 52.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $2,000.00 on Heroic\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/dota2-heroic-aur1-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Heroic and Aurora Gaming are set to face each other in a Best of 3 series during the ESL Dota 2 2025 DreamLeague Season 27 Main Event Group Stage - Round 4.

Leicester averages 1.83 goals scored/conceded while Ipswich averages 1.33 scored but only 0.5 conceded - Ipswich's defensive strength makes BTTS far from certain. Historical BTTS rates in Championship matches typically hover around 50-60%.\n\n**Wait - this edge favors NO significantly**\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 65%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -30.9% (bet NO)\nExpected Value: Betting NO at 4.1% implied when true probability of \"not BTTS\" is ~35% = massive value\nReasoning: 95.9% for BTTS is absurdly high. Ipswich concedes only 0.5 goals per game recently, and BTTS markets typically resolve around 50-65%. This is severely mispriced - NO has enormous edge.\n\n---\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 86%\nEdge: -61%\nExpected Value: Massive edge on NO side\nReasoning: A 2-degree window (42-43\u00b0F) when forecasts show \"lower 40s\" is extremely narrow. Even with good forecasts, hitting exactly 42-43\u00b0F has maybe 25-30% probability given forecast uncertainty of \u00b13-4 degrees.\n\n**Correction - this also favors NO**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 86%\nEdge: -61% (bet NO)\nExpected Value: Betting NO at 14% implied when true probability is ~75% = exceptional value\nReasoning: Forecasts show \"lower 40s\" but a precise 2-degree window has enormous uncertainty.

However, Ipswich's strong defensive form (0.5 conceded per game) suggests they might keep a clean sheet. The market at 95.9% is already pricing in very high confidence for BTTS, leaving minimal edge.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only -3.9%, below the 10% threshold required for a NO bet.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**NYC Temperature 42-43\u00b0F on December 13**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -51% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Weather forecasts show \"lower 40s\u00b0F\" which is a broad range (40-44\u00b0F). A specific 2-degree window (42-43\u00b0F) represents only ~20-25% of the likely temperature distribution. The historical average high is 38\u00b0F, making 42-43\u00b0F above average. The market is severely overpricing the probability of hitting this exact narrow range.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Massive 51% edge on NO side.

However, the overall record is nearly even (5-5-3), and both teams have identical recent form (1 win in last 5 matches).
