The 95.8% price doesn't account for natural attrition and potential competition from holiday releases.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 7.8%, below the 10% threshold.

(December 16, 2025)**\n\nYour Probability: 88%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -7.8%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge for NO bet\nReasoning: Despite the 60% viewership decline in week 2, Stranger Things 5 still had 23.6M views and remained #1. By week 3-4 (Dec 16), further decline is expected but no major competing releases are evident. The show will likely maintain top position, but 95.8% feels slightly overconfident given the steep decline trajectory and potential for a surprise competitor.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 70%\nMarket Price: 62%\nEdge: +8%\nExpected Value: +8% \u00d7 0.61 = +4.9%\nReasoning: Leverkusen at home (BayArena) against K\u00f6ln is a strong favorite scenario. Despite the recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg, Leverkusen historically dominates this fixture. K\u00f6ln showing only a draw from September suggests weaker form. Home advantage and squad quality favor Leverkusen significantly, but the Augsburg loss shows vulnerability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Edge of 8% is below the 10% threshold)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Partizan vs. KK Crvena Zvezda**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 74% (for Crvena Zvezda)\nEdge: -2%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has shown strong EuroLeague form and won the recent Serbian Cup. However, Partizan beat them 85-77 in April 2025 ABA League. The rivalry is highly competitive with home court being crucial. If this is at Partizan's home, 74% for Zvezda seems slightly high. The head-to-head is split, making this essentially a coin-flip adjusted for form.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**",
