The outage was attributed to a latent bug in Cloudflare's bot mitigation system, leading to cascading failures across its network. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/cloudflare-apologizes-after-outage-takes-major-websites-offline?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **December 5, 2025**: Another outage occurred, impacting approximately 28% of all HTTP traffic. This incident was caused by an internal configuration change related to mitigating a React Server Components vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182). ([blog.cloudflare.com](https://blog.cloudflare.com/5-december-2025-outage/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese incidents have raised concerns about Cloudflare's system resilience and the broader reliability of internet infrastructure.

This stopgap legislation, signed by President Donald Trump on November 12, 2025, effectively ended the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which had begun on October 1, 2025. ([printing.org](https://www.printing.org/content/2025/11/14/federal-government-reopens-following-passage-of-short-term-funding-deal?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe current funding measure does not include an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which are set to expire on December 31, 2025. This omission has been a point of contention, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) pledging to allow a vote on extending these subsidies by mid-December. ([agd.org](https://agd.org/about-agd/publications-news/newsroom/newsroom-list/2025/11/12/federal-government-shutdown-continues?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the approaching deadline for the ACA sub...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Fogo FDV above $3B one day after launch?\nRecent trade: $952.80 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/fogo-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe prediction market \"Fogo FDV above $3B one day after launch?\" is currently active on Polymarket, with a volume of $338,071 and an end date of January 1, 2027. As of December 12, 2025, the market is trading at 3% for the \"Yes\" outcome and 97% for the \"No\" outcome, indicating a strong consensus among traders that Fogo's Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) will not exceed $3 billion one day after its launch. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/fogo-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch/fogo-fdv-above-3b-one-day-after-launch-117?utm_source=openai))\n\nFogo's tokenomics, as outlined in their launch highlights, include a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with 18.23% (182.3 million tokens) in circulation at the Token Generation Event (TGE). The FDV at TGE is $150 million, suggesting that the market anticipates a valuation significantly below $3 billion shortly after launch.

However, the likelihood of another critical incident within the remaining weeks of December seems lower, especially given that they will likely be taking measures to prevent further issues. \n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The U.S. government is currently operating under a temporary funding measure that expires on January 30, 2026. The contentious issue surrounding the ACA premium tax credits, set to expire on December 31, 2025, suggests there is a high risk of another funding impasse, making a government shutdown by January 31 likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The current market sentiment is overwhelmingly against Fogo's FDV exceeding $3 billion one day after its launch, with 97% of trades on \"No.\" The initial FDV at TGE is $150 million, indicating it is unlikely to reach such a high valuation so quickly.",

Given the contentious ACA premium tax credit issue and historical difficulty in passing funding bills, there's substantial risk of at least a brief shutdown as negotiations come down to the wire.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The market is trading at 97% NO with strong consensus, and Fogo's tokenomics show an FDV at TGE of only $150 million\u2014requiring a 20x increase to reach $3B within one day of launch, which is extremely unlikely for any new token launch in current market conditions.",

With contentious issues like ACA subsidies unresolved and a history of last-minute negotiations, a brief shutdown around the January 30 deadline is plausible before the January 31 cutoff.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The market is trading at 97% No with strong consensus.
