Despite initial claims of high demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to replace the existing EB-5 visa program, which required investments tied to job creation. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected that selling one million Gold Cards could generate $5 trillion for the U.S. government.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 offers a significant edge to bet \"YES,\" with most AIs estimating a true probability above 95% against an 87% market price. For Market 1, analysts universally see no actionable edge, deeming the spread a near coin-flip. Regarding Market 3, there is clear disagreement, as some models see value in \"NO\" while others assess the market price as fair or even overvalued.",

The 6.5 point spread is substantial, and with Pacers' recent ATS success despite road struggles, this is essentially a coin flip.

Polymarket's own data shows only 31% chance he leaves Venezuela, and Kalshi shows only 23% for 2025. Maduro has survived multiple crises before. The 61% market price significantly overestimates the likelihood of departure within ~3.5 months - betting NO offers substantial value.",
