  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1 offers no clear 10%+ trade edge, with most AIs seeing the Thunder's high probability as already fairly priced. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement on the true probability, but a notable consensus that the \"NO\" side holds a massive edge if the resolution is strictly about distribution in 2025. Regarding Market 3, opinions are split on the direction, but several AIs identify a potential >10% edge on the Cavaliers covering the spread.",

While their winning streak suggests a high probability of victory, the market already prices this in heavily, leaving insufficient edge for a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nYour Probability: 99%  \nMarket Price: 97.5%  \nEdge: +1.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Not enough edge for a trade  \nReasoning: President Trump has announced plans to issue tariff dividend checks, and recent actions align with generating the necessary revenue. Given the clear intent and measures to fund these dividends, the probability is high, but the market is already close to the true probability, making it a NO_TRADE due to insufficient edge.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 40%  \nMarket Price: 52.0%  \nEdge: -12% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: Significant negative edge; value on NO side  \nReasoning: Despite being favored, the Cavaliers have struggled recently, and covering a 14.5-point spread is challenging, particularly against a team like the Wizards, who have a poor record but could still perform better than expected in single games. The market overvalues the Cavaliers' chances to cover the spread, providing a good opportunity to bet on NO.",

If the market resolves on whether dividends are actually distributed in 2025, this is extremely unlikely.

Covering such a large spread requires sustained focus, which struggling teams often lack.
