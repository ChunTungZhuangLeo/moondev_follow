([weathershogun.com](https://weathershogun.com/weather/usa/ny/new-york/3284/december?utm_source=openai))\n\nHistorically, December temperatures in New York City average a high of 42\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C) and a low of 29\u00b0F (-1.8\u00b0C). ([weather2visit.com](https://www.weather2visit.com/north-america/united-states/new-york-city-december.htm?utm_source=openai)) While the current forecast is slightly below the average high, it remains above the 33-34\u00b0F range.\n\nRecent weather patterns have brought colder conditions to the northeastern U.S., with sub-freezing temperatures setting new records from Iowa and Michigan to New York. This Arctic blast is expected to persist over the next couple of weeks, marking the most intense cold event of the season.

In fact, Gaetz resigned from Congress on November 13, 2024, following his nomination for Attorney General, a position he withdrew from on November 21, 2024. Consequently, a special election was held on April 1, 2025, to fill his seat, which was won by Republican Jimmy Patronis. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Florida%27s_1st_congressional_district_special_election?utm_source=openai))\n\nDuring the final days of Trump's first term, Gaetz reportedly sought a blanket preemptive pardon for himself and other congressional allies amid a federal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and potential violations of sex trafficking laws. However, Trump publicly denied that Gaetz had directly requested a pardon, stating, \"Congressman Matt Gaetz has never asked me for a pardon.\" ([foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/matt-gaetz-preem...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for all three markets, with unanimous 5-0 agreement on Markets 1 and 3. The only minor disagreement is on Market 2, where four AIs predict \"NO\" based on projections exceeding the range, while one AI predicts \"YES\" by interpreting the same $110M projection as falling within it. Overall, the synthesized view is that the NYC temperature will be above the range, Avatar's box office will exceed the range, and a Trump pardon for Gaetz is highly unlikely.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: The current weather forecast for December 12, 2025, predicts a high of 38\u00b0F in New York City, which is above the specified range of 33-34\u00b0F. Despite recent colder conditions in the northeast, the forecasted temperature remains outside the prediction market's range.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Early projections for \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" suggest an opening weekend box office between $100 million and $130 million, centering around $110 million. These estimates are above the $90 million to $101 million range specified in the market, making it unlikely that the film's box office will fall within this range.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: There is no current indication or news suggesting that Donald Trump plans to pardon Matt Gaetz. Gaetz's resignation and subsequent withdrawal from the Attorney General nomination, as well as the absence of any recent pardon requests or discussions, further support the likelihood that he will not receive a pardon from Trump in 2025.",
