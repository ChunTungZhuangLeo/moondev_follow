However, prediction markets have been active in forecasting his tweet activity for various periods in December 2025.\n\nFor instance, a market on Polymarket is currently trading on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The \"280-299\" tweet count range has a 5% chance of occurring, with a \"No\" price of 95.2%. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, a market predicting whether Musk will post between 1,320 and 1,359 tweets in December 2025 is trading at a 7.3% chance for the \"Yes\" outcome. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2025-1320-1359?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese markets reflect the collective expectations of participants regarding Musk's tweeting behavior in December 20\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 29.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $2,374.93 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/starladder-budapest-major-2025-winner\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 is nearing its conclusion, with the grand final scheduled for December 14. Team Spirit has demonstrated strong performance throughout the tournament, securing a spot in the semifinals after defeating Team Falcons 2-0 in the quarterfinals.

A bet on \"Over 2.5\" wins if the match ends with 3 or more goals, while \"Under 2.5\" wins if there are 2 or fewer goals scored.

For instance, the Dutch Eredivisie and the German Bundesliga have historically seen a higher percentage of matches with over 2.5 goals.

There's confusion in the data presented, but Musk's typical December volume (1,320-1,359 monthly suggests ~40-45 tweets/week) makes 280-299 in 8 days extremely unlikely. However, data inconsistency makes this untradeable.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +16% \u00d7 2.45 payout = +39.2%\nReasoning: Team Spirit just defeated Falcons 2-0 in quarterfinals and leads tournament viewership (560k avg), indicating strong form and momentum. Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15% implied) seem outdated given their current performance. They're in semifinals with grand final December 14\u2014market significantly undervalues their chances.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (OVER 2.5)\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +12.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +12% \u00d7 2.0 payout = +24%\nReasoning: This is Team Spirit vs Vitality in a CS2 Major semifinal (December 13). High-stakes elimination matches between top teams typically go to 3+ maps. Recent $990 bet on Over suggests sharp money agrees. Spirit's momentum and Vitality's quality makes a 3-map series (BO3) highly probable, well above the 50% coin flip pricing.",

      "response": "I'll analyze each market carefully based on the provided context.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 1: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 85.2%\nEdge: -80.2%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\n\nReasoning: There's a critical discrepancy here. The web search shows the \"280-299\" range has only a 5% chance with \"No\" at 95.2% on Polymarket itself. The 85.2% \"YES\" price shown appears to be an error or I'm misreading the market. Based on the actual Polymarket data showing this specific narrow range at ~5% YES probability, the true probability for hitting exactly 280-299 tweets in a week is very low. Musk's tweeting is variable, and hitting a specific 20-tweet range out of hundreds is unlikely.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: -1%\nExpected Value: Negligible\n\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals (top 4) after beating Falcons 2-0, showing strong form. With 4 teams remaining, a baseline probability would be ~25%. Their strong performance and pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (~18% implied) suggest they're performing above expectations. However, they still need to win 2 more matches against elite competition. The 29% price seems fairly accurate for a semifinalist with good momentum.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match TS7 vs VIT)**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) match between Team Spirit and Vitality at the Budapest Major. In CS2 best-of-3 matches at Major semifinals, evenly matched teams often go to 3 maps. Both teams reaching this stage suggests competitive parity. Historical Major semifinal data shows roughly 50-60% of matches go to 3 games when teams are closely matched. The 50/50 price is reasonable, though I'd lean slightly toward Over given the stakes and team quality.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- Market 1: **NO** (massive edge if market truly shows 85.2% YES)\n- Market 2: **NO_TRADE** (fair price)\n- Market 3: **NO_TRADE** (insufficient edge)",
