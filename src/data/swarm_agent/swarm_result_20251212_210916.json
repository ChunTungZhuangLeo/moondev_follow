In a December 10, 2025, podcast interview, Musk described his involvement as \"somewhat successful\" but stated he would not participate again. He acknowledged that while DOGE claimed to have saved billions through measures like workforce reductions and asset sales, the lack of transparent financial reporting made these claims unverifiable. The initiative was disbanded eight months early, as confirmed by Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor.

Prediction markets, such as Polymarket, reflect a 93.5% probability of the model's release by December 18, 2025. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/gemini-3pt0-flash-released-by-december-18?utm_source=openai))\n\nGoogle has not yet made an official announcement regarding the exact release date of Gemini 3.0 Flash. The model is expected to succeed the Gemini 2.5 series, offering enhanced performance and capabilities. ([aigazine.com](https://aigazine.com/industry/gemini-30-launch-expected-as-older-models-face-deprecation--s?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe high confidence in the release date, as indicated by prediction markets, suggests that the launch is imminent. However, until Google provides an official confirmation, the exact release date remains speculative. \n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees Market 1 should resolve to NO, as the event date has passed with GOOGL closing at $308.35. For Market 2, most analysts assign a low true probability (15-50%) and see significant edge in betting NO against the high market price. Regarding Market 3, opinions vary more, but the common theme is a high estimated probability (around 85%) that is slightly below the market price, making a strong trade recommendation unclear.",

The stock has shown a decline and without any significant positive catalysts by December 12, it is unlikely to close above $310 by the end of the week.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 50%  \nMarket Price: 87.9%  \nEdge: -37.9% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -37.9% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: While there were efforts to reduce the deficit, the lack of transparent financial reporting and the early disbandment of the DOGE initiative cast doubt on the effectiveness and verifiability of these efforts. Musk himself stated the initiative was only \"somewhat successful\", suggesting the probability is much lower than the market's current estimate.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 85%  \nMarket Price: 92.0%  \nEdge: -7% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -7% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: The high confidence from prediction markets and the anticipation of the release between December 16 and December 31 supports a high probability of release by December 18.

The stock dropped 1.31% today and is trading below $310 with limited time to recover. The intraday high touched $315 but couldn't hold, suggesting resistance.

The lack of transparent financial reporting and Musk's departure suggest the deficit reduction efforts may not meet whatever threshold this market requires.

GOOGL closed at $308.35 on Dec 12, and the question asks about the week of Dec 8. This appears to be a resolved market that hasn't settled yet.
