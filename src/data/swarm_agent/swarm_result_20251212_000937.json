  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly favors the Over (YES) for Market 2 due to Denver's historic offense versus Sacramento's struggling defense. For Market 1, most analysts lean toward NO (Blazers not covering -5.5) citing both teams' poor form and key injuries, though some advise avoiding the trade. Predictions for Market 3 are split between YES (Over) and NO/Under, reflecting disagreement on whether Boston's scoring surge will overcome the high NHL total.",

The uncertainty in performance makes it difficult to confidently bet on the spread.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The Nuggets are having their best start in franchise history, with strong performances from key players, suggesting they can score heavily. Coupled with the Kings' defensive struggles, highlighted by their significant loss to the Grizzlies, betting on the \"Over\" seems favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Despite the Bruins' recent scoring surge, the Jets' inconsistent performance creates uncertainty in total goals. The recent trade on the \"Under\" reflects caution, and without clearer indicators, it's best to avoid taking a position.",

The recent $1,710 trade on Pelicans suggests sharp money disagrees with the 5.5-point spread favoring Portland, and the Blazers' poor form makes covering this spread unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: OVER\nReasoning: Denver's offense is elite with their 17-6 record and Joki\u0107 leading the way, while Sacramento's defense has collapsed during their 8-game losing streak (allowing 41 points in their last loss). The recent $6,275 trade on Over aligns with the matchup dynamics favoring a high-scoring game exceeding 237.5 points.\n\nMARKET 3: UNDER\nReasoning: Despite Boston's recent scoring surge (18 goals in 4 games), Winnipeg's defensive struggles (6-2 loss to Edmonton) suggest both teams' defensive issues, but the 6.5 total is high for NHL. The recent $800 trade on Under and typical NHL scoring patterns favor staying below this elevated total.",
