  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 (BIG vs. Sangal) presents a clear positive edge, with most AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade due to BIG's statistical advantages. For Market 1 (NBA Over/Under), opinions are split on the edge's size, leading to no clear trade consensus, while Market 3 (Israel-Lebanon) is widely seen as overpriced, with most analysts assigning a lower probability than the market. Overall, Market 2 is the only one with consistent, actionable support for a trade.",
