  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts the Giants will cover the -2.5 spread due to the Commanders' quarterback injury, but the Texas primary markets show clear division. For Market 1, most AIs predict Cornyn will lose, though one dissents and another abstains due to uncertainty, while Market 2 sees a majority predicting a Paxton win with notable opposition citing a split conservative vote. Overall, the political markets are viewed as highly competitive and uncertain, whereas the sports prediction is seen as more straightforward based on the injury news.",

Recent developments indicate a challenging primary for Cornyn, and the substantial recent trade on \"No\" suggests market sentiment aligns with this view.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Ken Paxton is currently leading in the polls against John Cornyn and Wesley Hunt, indicating strong support within the Republican base. His positioning as a conservative alternative and the poll data showing him ahead suggest he has a good chance of winning the primary.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: With the Washington Commanders' starting quarterback injured and Marcus Mariota stepping in, the Giants' chances of covering a 2.5-point spread are bolstered. The Giants' favored status and the Commanders' quarterback situation make betting against the Commanders (and thus on the Giants covering the spread) seem favorable.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: Despite Paxton's entry and tight polling (34% vs 33%), Cornyn remains a well-funded incumbent with establishment support. In a three-way race with Wesley Hunt splitting the conservative vote, Cornyn's path to victory in a potentially fragmented field gives him an edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While Paxton leads narrowly in polls, the vote split with Wesley Hunt (21-22%) among conservative challengers likely benefits Cornyn. Paxton's impeachment baggage and Cornyn's incumbency advantages make Paxton winning less probable than current polling suggests.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: With Jayden Daniels out due to elbow injury and Marcus Mariota starting for Washington, the Giants have a significant advantage at home. The 2.5-point spread is reasonable given the Commanders' diminished offensive capability without their starting QB.",

With significant uncertainty and multiple viable candidates including Wesley Hunt at 22%, this primary outcome is too close to call confidently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Paxton leads in recent polls (34% vs Cornyn's 33%), the margin is within statistical noise and Wesley Hunt's 22% support could shift dynamics. The race remains too competitive and unpredictable this far from the primary to justify a position on either side.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The recent $8,617.91 bet on Commanders appears to overreact to Jayden Daniels' injury. While Marcus Mariota starting is a downgrade, the Giants are still favored by 2.5 points at home, and the betting line hasn't moved enough to suggest the market has fully corrected. The Giants covering -2.5 remains the more likely outcome.",
