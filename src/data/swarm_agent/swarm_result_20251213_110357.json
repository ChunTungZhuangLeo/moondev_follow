The recent performance metrics also suggest both teams have their strengths, making this a close match that doesn't present a clear betting opportunity.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Runa Team is ranked #21 and has secured more recent victories compared to Amaru Gaming, which is unranked and recently lost 0-2 to Team Yandex. The recent form and ranking favor Runa Team, making them a stronger candidate for winning this series.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Given Eintracht Frankfurt's decent form with 3 wins in their last 6 matches and FC Augsburg's poor away performance, combined with the fact that recent trades have favored the Over, there is a good chance that the match could see more than 2.5 goals.",
