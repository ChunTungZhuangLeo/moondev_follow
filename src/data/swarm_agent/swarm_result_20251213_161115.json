  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly favors \"NO\" for Maduro remaining in power, citing economic reports and a lack of imminent ousting evidence. There is significant disagreement on Market 2, with models split between \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE\" due to vague context, while all agree on \"NO_TRADE\" for the Dota 2 match given the teams' identical poor form. Overall, only Market 1 has clear, unified predictive reasoning from the AI models.",

The recent economic growth announcements may bolster his position, but U.S. sanctions and opposition movements create uncertainty. Given this mixed environment, a NO_TRADE decision is prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Without specific details about which leaders are listed in this market and the lack of concrete information on imminent political changes, it is difficult to make an informed prediction. The general political instability in different countries does not provide enough clarity on a global scale for this market.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Both Passion UA and Team Nemesis have poor recent records and are closely ranked, suggesting an evenly matched game. However, given the higher recent trade volume on Team Nemesis and their slightly better ranking, betting on Team Nemesis to win seems more favorable.",
