However, without information on the full slate of competitors or any historical patterns in voting, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Despite Aurora's recent victory over Tundra Esports, Tundra's strong performance in recent matches and higher world ranking suggest they are in better form. Additionally, the recent trading activity favoring Tundra indicates market confidence in their victory.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Elon Musk's tweeting habits align closely with the range in question (420-439 tweets over a week), making it likely he will fall within this range given his average daily output.
