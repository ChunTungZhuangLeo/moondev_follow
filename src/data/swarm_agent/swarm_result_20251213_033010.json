A bet on \"Over 2.5\" wins if the match ends with 3 or more goals, while a bet on \"Under 2.5\" wins if the match ends with 0, 1, or 2 goals.

([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/lighter-market-cap-fdv-one-day-after-launch/lighter-market-cap-fdv-14b-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai))\n\nAs of now, the market shows a 3% chance (buy Yes at 2.7\u00a2, buy No at 97.3\u00a2) that Lighter's FDV will surpass $14 billion within 24 hours post-launch. This indicates a low probability among participants for such a high valuation shortly after launch.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the market also reflects a higher probability for lower valuation thresholds. For instance, there's an 83% chance (buy Yes at 84\u00a2, buy No at 16\u00a2) that Lighter's FDV will exceed $2 billion one day after launch.

  "consensus_summary": "All five AI models unanimously agree on \"NO_TRADE\" for Markets 1 and 2, citing the provided soccer news context as irrelevant to the CS2 esports matches, making any prediction speculative. They also share a strong consensus for \"NO\" on Market 3, aligning with the market's indicated 3% probability and recent trading activity against Lighter's FDV exceeding $14B.

Without team-specific performance data, taking a position would be speculative.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Similar to Market 1, the context lacks specific information about the teams involved (CS2 FAZE vs NAVI) and their current form or scoring tendencies. Without these details, it's challenging to make an informed prediction regarding the over/under 2.5 goals market.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The market data indicates only a 3% chance that Lighter's FDV will surpass $14 billion one day after launch, suggesting that the consensus is strongly against such an outcome. Given this low probability and the significant volume of trading reflecting this sentiment, betting \"No\" aligns with the prevailing market view.",

Without relevant information about the specific CS2 match or teams, an informed prediction cannot be made.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Similar to Market 1, the news context discusses soccer goal totals and is irrelevant to a CS2 \"Games Total\" market. Lacking specific information about the FaZe vs. NaVi CS2 match, it's impossible to make an educated prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The market currently shows a very low 3% probability for Lighter's FDV to exceed $14B one day after launch, with participants buying \"No\" at 97.3\u00a2. This strong market consensus, highlighted in the news context, indicates a high unlikelihood of reaching such a valuation.",

Without specific CS2 match data on these teams' map tendencies, I cannot make an informed prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is a CS2 match between FaZe and NAVI, but again the context provided relates to soccer betting rather than esports.
