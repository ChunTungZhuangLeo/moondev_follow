However, prediction markets have been actively tracking and forecasting his Twitter activity during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, a contract titled \"Elon Musk # tweets December 9 - December 16, 2025?\" has garnered significant attention, with a total volume of approximately $3 million. The market is currently trading at a 5% chance that Musk will post between 280 and 299 tweets during this timeframe. The highest probability is for him to post between 360 and 379 tweets, with a 12.1% chance. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese odds suggest that market participants anticipate a higher level of activity from Musk on Twitter during this period, with the 280-299 tweet range being less likely.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's 85.2% price as a likely error versus the cited 5% market probability, with most models advising against a trade due to this data conflict. For Market 2, there is strong agreement that Team Spirit's probability is higher than the 29.0% market price, with three models recommending a \"YES\" trade citing their strong semifinal form. Regarding Market 3, all models that provided an edge calculation found it below the 10% threshold, resulting in a unanimous \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation.",

The web search context explicitly states that Polymarket itself shows only a 5% chance for the 280-299 tweet range, with 360-379 tweets being more likely at 12.1%. The 85.2% price shown appears to be an error or I'm misreading the market structure. Based on the actual Polymarket data cited, this range is quite unlikely given Musk's typical high-volume posting patterns.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +6% (35% - 29%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after a strong 2-0 win over Falcons, showing excellent form with standout performances. Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (roughly 18%) have improved given their advancement. With likely 2 matches remaining (semi + potential final), they're performing well but still need to win two Bo3s against top competition. The market seems reasonably priced.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match)**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5% (55% - 50%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (maps total, not soccer goals). In CS2 Bo3 matches, going to 3 maps (Over 2.5) happens roughly 50-60% of the time depending on team skill parity. Without specific information on the teams' recent form or head-to-head, the 50% price is reasonable. Insufficient edge to trade.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",

Elon typically tweets much more actively. The 85.2% price appears to be an error or misread - this is likely showing a different outcome bucket. Based on actual market data cited, 280-299 range has ~5% chance, making this severely overpriced at 85.2%.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - The market pricing seems inconsistent with the reported data. Without clarity on what the 85.2% actually represents, cannot recommend a position despite apparent mispricing.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +16% \u00d7 2.45x payout = +39.2%\nReasoning: Team Spirit just beat Team Falcons 2-0 to reach semifinals, showing dominant form with zweih securing aces on both maps. They lead tournament viewership (560k average) and were pre-tournament favorites at 5.50 odds (~18% implied). In semifinals with strong momentum, their true win probability is 40-50%, making 29% significantly undervalued.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge with recent performance momentum not fully priced in.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +5% \u00d7 2.0x payout = +10%\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match between Team Spirit and Vitality. Context shows general soccer O/U 2.5 trends (58.6% in MLS), but without specific team stats for this CS2 match, and with the market already at 50-50, there's insufficient edge. Recent $990 bet on Over suggests some informed action, but edge is marginal.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge below 10% threshold; market fairly priced given available information.",
