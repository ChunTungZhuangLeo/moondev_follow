Market 2 is split between **YES** (valuable spread with returning players) and **NO_TRADE** (injury uncertainty), showing no clear agreement.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The Chicago Bulls are on a seven-game losing streak and recently suffered a significant defeat, indicating poor form. The Charlotte Hornets, although also struggling, benefit from recent rest. Given the current performance trend of the Bulls, betting against them covering a -3.5 spread seems prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The Buccaneers are favored, but they face uncertainty with key players like Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan listed as questionable and Baker Mayfield recovering from an injury. This uncertainty makes it difficult to confidently bet on the Buccaneers covering the spread.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Both teams have shown offensive capabilities, with the Panthers scoring over 2.5 goals in most recent away games and the Avalanche having a strong home scoring record. The combination of these offensive trends supports the likelihood of a total over 6.5 goals.",

Both teams are in poor form, and road favorites on losing streaks covering spreads is risky - I'd lean toward the Hornets keeping it close at home.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The Buccaneers are getting key weapons back with Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan activated from IR, and they're playing at home against a Falcons team in a divisional matchup where Tampa has motivation. The 2.5 spread is more favorable than the reported 4.5 line, making this attractive value.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Colorado averages 3.4 goals at home while Florida has scored 2.5+ goals in 6 of 7 road games but allows over 3 goals per game on average. With both teams capable of scoring and Florida's defensive struggles on the road, the over 6.5 looks achievable in this matchup between two offensive-minded teams.",
