      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: Real Sociedad and Girona have both shown tendencies for balanced scoring in recent matches, with Real Sociedad scoring and conceding 11 goals in their last 7 home games. Girona's recent defensive struggles, highlighted by their 3-0 loss to Elche, suggest a higher likelihood of the match having more than 1.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The Army Black Knights average slightly above the points UMBC allows, and UMBC has a strong home defense, especially with their defensive rebounding capabilities. This suggests that the total score is less likely to exceed 145.5, making the under a more favorable position.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: RB Leipzig's recent 6-0 victory and Union Berlin's defensive vulnerabilities, evidenced by their consecutive losses, suggest a high-scoring game. Given Leipzig's offensive prowess and Union Berlin's recent form, the match is likely to exceed 3.5 goals.",

Both teams have shown scoring capability, and 145.5 is a reasonable total that should be achievable with Army's offensive output combined with UMBC's home court advantage.\n\nMARKET 3: OVER\nReasoning: RB Leipzig just demolished Frankfurt 6-0 and sits second in the league in excellent form, while Union Berlin is struggling defensively (conceded 3 to Wolfsburg, on 3-game losing streak). Leipzig's attacking prowess against Union's poor defensive form strongly suggests 4+ total goals.",
