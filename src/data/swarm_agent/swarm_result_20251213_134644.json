Given their consistent success and past victories over Spirit, Vitality is more likely to win Map 1.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both FC S\u00fcdtirol and SSC Bari have been inconsistent, with neither team showing a clear advantage in recent form. The match is crucial for both teams' survival hopes, making it unpredictable. Therefore, taking a position is risky due to the closely contested nature of the match.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While there has been a recent Israeli military action targeting a key Hamas figure, there is no official announcement or indication of a broader strike planned for December 14. The situation is sensitive and could change rapidly, but current information suggests a move towards a ceasefire, making it uncertain whether further strikes will occur imminently.",
