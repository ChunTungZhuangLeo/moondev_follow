The 76ers are favored by 6.5 points in this matchup. ([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** In their last game on December 7, 2025, the 76ers narrowly lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, 112-108. Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds, while Joel Embiid struggled with 16 points on 4-of-21 shooting.

Applications opened on December 10, 2025, with a processing fee of $15,000. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/22edbd7e65d188bbf6c8ec1d5f78d11a?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite the program's official launch, prediction markets indicate a low likelihood of significant sales in 2025. On Polymarket, the probability of selling zero Gold Cards by the end of the year is currently at 67%, with a total trading volume of $1.63 million. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/will-trump-sell-0-gold-cards-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis low demand is further reflected in the program's pricing history. Initially announced at $5 million per card, the price was reduced to $1 million in September 2025, suggesting a lack of interest at the higher price point.

However, recent developments suggest increasing international pressure and internal challenges that could influence his tenure.\n\n**U.S. Sanctions and Military Actions**\n\nOn December 10, 2025, the United States seized the VLCC Skipper, a large oil tanker off Venezuela's coast, accusing it of transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. President Trump described the operation as a significant national security action, while Venezuela condemned it as \"piracy\" and \"theft.\" ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe following day, December 11, the U.S. imposed sanctions on three nephews of Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores and six crude oil tankers, alleging involvement in deceptive practices supporting Maduro's administration.

The Pacers have shown recent improvement, making the outcome uncertain.

Pacers on 2-game win streak showing momentum. Edge exists but below 10% threshold for action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -62.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +62% on NO position\nReasoning: Program officially launched Dec 10 with $15,000 processing fee and $1M price point (down from $5M). With 19 days remaining in 2025 and applications now open, probability of ZERO sales is extremely low. Market severely overpricing YES.\n\n**STRONG NO RECOMMENDATION** - Market implies 87% chance of zero sales despite active program with reduced pricing and open applications. Even 1-2 sales would win NO position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -26.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +26% on NO position\nReasoning: Despite increased US sanctions and tanker seizures, Maduro has survived similar pressure for years. No credible internal opposition or military defection signals. 3.5-month timeline is extremely aggressive for regime change in entrenched dictatorship.\n\n**MODERATE NO RECOMMENDATION** - Market overestimates probability of rapid regime change.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 46.7%\nEdge: -4.7%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The 76ers covering 6.5 points is uncertain given Embiid's recent poor shooting (4-21) and the Pacers' momentum with two straight wins. However, home court advantage and Maxey's strong play partially offset this. The edge is too small to justify a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -32%\nExpected Value: ~2.5x potential return on NO bet\nReasoning: The market at 87% for ZERO sales seems dramatically overpriced. The program just launched December 10th with 20 days remaining in 2025. Even at $1M, wealthy individuals seeking expedited US residency exist globally - Chinese, Russian, Middle Eastern investors have historically paid similar amounts for EB-5 visas. Only ONE sale needed to resolve NO. The 67% figure from the search appears outdated; current 87% is mispriced.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -26%\nReasoning: While there's increased US pressure (tanker seizure, sanctions), Maduro has survived similar or worse pressure for years. He controls the military, has Russian/Chinese backing, and authoritarian leaders rarely leave voluntarily. However, I'm uncertain enough about black swan events (coup, assassination, negotiated exit) that I wouldn't bet heavily. The 61% seems too high but unpredictable geopolitics make this risky. Edge exists but confidence is low.\n\nWait, let me reconsider Market 3:\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -26%\nExpected Value: ~0.67x potential return on NO bet\nReasoning: Maduro has survived years of sanctions, protests, and international pressure. Military remains loyal, and he has external support from Russia/China/Cuba. Authoritarian leaders rarely exit peacefully within short timeframes. 61% probability of removal by March 2026 is significantly overpriced.",
