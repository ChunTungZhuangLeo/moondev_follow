On November 12, 2025, Polymarket data indicated a 68% probability that Lighter's FDV would surpass $3 billion the day after launch. ([bitget.com](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605058794?utm_source=openai)) Subsequently, on December 7, 2025, the same platform reported a 72% probability for the FDV exceeding $1 billion and a 67% probability for exceeding $2 billion, with a trading volume surpassing $15.45 million. ([bitget.site](https://www.bitget.site/en/amp/news/detail/12560605100742?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese figures suggest a strong market expectation for Lighter's FDV to exceed $1 billion shortly after its launch, with a significant likelihood of surpassing $2 billion.

Vance would be a great nominee.\" ([aol.com](https://www.aol.com/rubio-2028-election-think-jd-143236894.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Private Discussions:** Reports from November 2025 indicate that Rubio has privately acknowledged Vance as the leading contender for the Republican nomination and has expressed a willingness to support him if Vance decides to run.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Marco Rubio's market is severely overpriced, with most models recommending a \"NO\" trade due to his endorsements of another candidate. For the Lighter token market, opinions are split between seeing value on \"YES\" and \"NO,\" indicating high uncertainty and no clear edge. Regarding the Angers SCO match, estimates of the true probability vary widely, leading to mixed trade signals and no unified recommendation.",

Given their higher league position and recent victory over Nantes, I estimate a higher probability for Angers winning than the market suggests.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: +0.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.1% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: While there is significant interest and trading volume around Lighter's launch, the probability of exceeding a $3 billion FDV seems fairly balanced. The market price closely reflects the uncertainty of achieving this valuation.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 20%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -75.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -75.9% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: Marco Rubio has not announced a candidacy and appears to support J.D.

Typical home win rates in Ligue 1 for teams of Angers' caliber are around 40-45%. Despite Nantes' poor form, draws are common in these matches, and 55% significantly overestimates Angers' win probability.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lighter market cap (FDV) >$3B one day after launch?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -4.9%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: The market has moved significantly from earlier predictions of 67-68% down to ~50%, reflecting increased uncertainty. While crypto launches are volatile and $3B FDV is ambitious, the current price appears reasonably calibrated given the information available. Edge is insufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Marco Rubio win the 2028 US Presidential Election?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -90.9%\nExpected Value: Massive edge on NO (90.9% \u00d7 ~1.04 = ~95% ROI on NO)\nReasoning: This price is almost certainly an error or manipulation. Rubio himself has endorsed JD Vance for 2028 and indicated he won't run. No credible scenario exists where Rubio has a 95.9% chance of winning the presidency. The true probability is likely under 5%, making NO an overwhelming value bet.",
