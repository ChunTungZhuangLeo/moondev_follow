  "consensus_summary": "The consensus across all three AI models is to avoid trading on Market 1, as their estimated probabilities cluster near the market price, showing no significant edge. For Markets 2 and 3, all analysts agree the current \"Yes\" prices are overvalued, recommending \"No\" bets, though they disagree on the exact probability estimates and edge calculations. Overall, no trade meets the required 10%+ positive edge for a \"Yes\" bet, with Markets 2 and 3 presenting potential value on the \"No\" side according to the analysis.",
