This initiative replaces the previous EB-5 visa program and aims to attract top global talent, particularly graduates of U.S. universities facing visa constraints. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed a $15,000 applicant vetting fee and emphasized rigorous background checks. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/22edbd7e65d188bbf6c8ec1d5f78d11a?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe program has generated significant interest, with 10,000 people pre-registering. It is expected to generate billions of dollars, positioning it as an economic boost targeting affluent immigrants. However, it has sparked controversy for effectively creating a pay-to-play system, especially as other immigration avenues for refugees, asylum seekers, and low-income applicants are being...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will FCSB vs. Feyenoord Rotterdam end in a draw?\nRecent trade: $660.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/uel-ste-fey-2025-12-11\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe upcoming UEFA Europa League match between FCSB and Feyenoord Rotterdam is set for December 11, 2025, at Arena Na\u021bional\u0103 in Bucharest.

Russian commanders have reported to President Vladimir Putin that their forces have taken full control of Siversk, describing it as a significant step toward capturing Sloviansk, another major city in Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commanders-tell-putin-that-russia-has-captured-siversk-eastern-ukraine-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian military has firmly denied these claims, stating that Siversk remains under their control. They acknowledge Russian attempts to infiltrate the town in small groups, particularly under unfavorable weather conditions, but assert that most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches.

The match's unpredictability makes it difficult to bet on a draw with any certainty.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: There are conflicting reports about the control of Siversk, with Russian commanders claiming capture and the Ukrainian military denying it. The lack of independent verification and ongoing contestation make it difficult to predict the outcome by December 22.",

The low threshold of 1-100 cards is easily met given the significant interest and recent launch.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both FCSB and Feyenoord Rotterdam are struggling in the Europa League and are tied in points, suggesting a closely contested match. FCSB's recent form includes a 0-0 draw, indicating their capacity for defensive stalemates, making a draw a plausible outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Russian commanders officially reported to President Putin on December 11, 2025, that their forces have taken full control of Siversk. While Ukraine denies this, the explicit Russian claim of capture, if verified or not definitively disproven by the deadline, supports a \"Yes\" outcome.",

Without clarity on which \"Gold Cards\" the market references, this is untradeable.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Both teams are struggling with poor Europa League form (3 points from 5 matches each), but FCSB is particularly weak at home (winless) and coming off a 3-0 cup defeat. Feyenoord, despite challenges, has superior quality as a Dutch Eredivisie side and should edge this match.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite Russian commanders claiming capture to Putin on December 11th, Ukrainian military firmly denies this and states Siversk remains under their control with Russian infiltration attempts being repelled. With only 11 days until the December 22nd deadline and conflicting claims suggesting ongoing contestation, full Russian control by deadline appears unlikely.",
