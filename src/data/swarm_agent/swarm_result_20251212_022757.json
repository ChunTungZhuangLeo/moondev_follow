Cerd\u00e1n resigned from his party role and parliamentary seat following the revelations. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/12/corruption-allegations-intensify-around-spain-government-as-mp-resigns?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Sexual Harassment Claims:** In July 2025, Francisco Salazar, a senior official in S\u00e1nchez's administration, resigned after multiple allegations of sexual harassment emerged.

Recent developments, however, suggest that such a transition may be under consideration.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **U.S. Seizure of Oil Tanker:** On December 10, 2025, the United States seized the VLCC Skipper, a large oil tanker off Venezuela's coast, accusing it of transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. This action has intensified tensions between Washington and Caracas.

Recent news coverage has focused on other controversial remarks and actions by Trump, but none involve the use of this specific slur.\n\nIn May 2024, former \"Apprentice\" producer Bill Pruitt alleged that Trump used the N-word during the show's filming in 2004. Trump's campaign denied the claim, labeling it \"completely fabricated.\" ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/05/30/trump-used-n-word-apprentice-producer-says-biden-calls-foe-racist/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn July 2024, Trump's nephew, Fred Trump III, claimed in his book that he heard Trump use the N-word in the 1970s. Trump's campaign dismissed the allegation as \"completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order.\" ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/07/24/trumps-nephew-reportedly-claim...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

With only ~3 weeks left in 2025 and no imminent no-confidence vote or resignation announcement, he's likely to survive the year.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: There is no official confirmation of Maduro agreeing to resign, Russia continues to support him, and authoritarian leaders rarely leave power voluntarily. The U.S. sanctions and pressure have not historically succeeded in removing him, and ~7 weeks is insufficient time for regime change without extraordinary circumstances.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: There's no evidence Trump has used the N-word publicly in December 2025, and despite his history of controversial statements, using this specific slur publicly would be politically catastrophic even for him.

The U.S. oil tanker seizure has actually intensified tensions, and with only ~7 weeks until the deadline, a voluntary departure appears extremely improbable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: There are no credible reports of Trump using this slur in December 2025 as of December 12th.
