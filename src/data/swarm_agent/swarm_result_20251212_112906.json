Given Angers' recent performance and Nantes' poor form, I estimate a higher probability than the market for an Angers win.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 68%  \nMarket Price: 49.9%  \nEdge: +18.1% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +9.05% (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)  \nReasoning: Given the significant market interest and the fact that Lighter's trading volume is leading among its peers, the true probability of exceeding a $3B FDV seems to be higher. However, the market price doesn't reflect this increased likelihood due to recent betting trends. Because the market seems to be catching up, there is still potential for an edge, but it's just at the threshold for a recommendation.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 3.5%  \nMarket Price: 95.9%  \nEdge: -92.4% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -92.4% (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)  \nReasoning: Marco Rubio has not declared a candidacy for the 2028 election and has shown support for another candidate, JD Vance.

The market at 55% significantly overvalues Angers. Football matches have inherent variance, and even with Nantes struggling, a 55% win probability is too high for a mid-table Ligue 1 clash.

Lighter has exceptional fundamentals with $11B daily trading volume (beating Hyperliquid), strong DeFi momentum, and significant investor interest ($3.97M prediction volume).

Rubio has NOT declared candidacy, publicly supports JD Vance, and prediction markets show him at only 3.5% odds. JD Vance leads at 28%. A 95.9% probability for Rubio is completely inconsistent with all available evidence. This is either a display error or extreme mispricing - strongly bet NO.",
