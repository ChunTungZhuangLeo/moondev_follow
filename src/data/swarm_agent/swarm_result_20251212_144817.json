The project's co-founder, Alon Cohen, has previously stated that while an airdrop is planned, it is not a current priority. ([blocknews.com](https://blocknews.com/pump-fun-founder-confirms-pump-token-airdrop-not-happening-in-immediate-future-here-is-what-we-know/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn July 2025, Cohen confirmed that the airdrop would not occur in the immediate future, leading to a significant decline in the PUMP token's price. ([xt.com](https://www.xt.com/en/blog/post/pump-funs-delayed-airdrop-plan-triggers-massive-sell-off?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, a prediction market on Polymarket indicates a 21% chance of an airdrop by December 31, 2025, with the majority (77%) betting against it.

This matchup marks the second meeting between the two teams this season; the Panthers previously secured a 4-3 shootout victory on November 1, 2025.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/nhl/stars-forge-3-goal-lead-hold-off-jets--flm-2025-12-10/?utm_source=openai)) Rantanen leads the team with 20 goals and 20 assists this season.

However, recent developments provide insight into her potential prospects:\n\n**Recent News and Official Announcements:**\n\n- **Memoir Release and Public Appearances:** In September 2025, Harris released her memoir, *107 Days*, detailing her 2024 presidential campaign. She has been actively promoting the book through media appearances, including an interview with Stephen Colbert, where she criticized the political system and media institutions. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/88b2b68dc8b9f191d79fc6b582a7828a?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Non-Candidacy for California Governorship:** In July 2025, Harris announced she would not run for governor of California in the 2026 election, ending speculation about her immediate political plans.

The majority of bets on Polymarket are against the airdrop, and recent news suggests it is unlikely to happen by December 31.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The Dallas Stars are on a four-game home winning streak and have a strong overall and home record. Their recent performance, including a victory over the Winnipeg Jets, suggests they are well-positioned to defeat the Florida Panthers, who they narrowly lost to in a shootout previously.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Kamala Harris has not declared her candidacy for the 2028 Democratic nomination, and while she remains in the public eye with her memoir and media appearances, there is insufficient information to predict her chances of winning the nomination at this time.",

      "response": "Here are my predictions for each market:\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\nReasoning: The Pump.fun co-founder explicitly stated in July 2025 that an airdrop is \"not a current priority\" and won't happen in the immediate future. With only ~19 days left until December 31 and no official announcement, the likelihood of an airdrop occurring is very low.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\nReasoning: This is a close NHL matchup between two strong teams - the Stars have home advantage and a 4-game home winning streak, but the Panthers won their previous meeting this season. The game is too evenly matched to identify clear value without knowing the current odds.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO**\nReasoning: While Harris hasn't ruled out 2028, she's nearly three years away from the nomination with no declared candidacy, and the Democratic field is wide open. Her decision not to run for California governor in 2026 keeps options open but doesn't signal strong momentum toward 2028, and historical patterns show failed nominees rarely secure subsequent nominations.",

With only 18 days remaining until December 31 and no official announcement, the 77% betting against it on Polymarket reflects the reality that there's insufficient time for implementation.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Dallas has a strong 4-game home winning streak and better overall record (21-6-5), Florida previously beat them 4-3 in shootout this season. The $1,500 recent bet on Stars suggests market confidence, but this appears fairly priced given both teams' competitive strength.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Harris has shown no indication of running for 2028, explicitly declining the 2026 California governor race and focusing on book promotion rather than campaign infrastructure. Her post-2024 loss positioning suggests she's stepping back from electoral politics, and the Democratic party typically doesn't renominate consecutive losers.",
