  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong edge for betting YES on Leverkusen, with three models recommending it based on home advantage and historical dominance. For the Netflix market, most agree the current price is too high given viewership decay, but the edge is insufficient for a trade. Regarding the basketball game, opinions are mixed but lean against the market favorite, though no clear high-edge trade emerges.",

The market question is for December 16, 2025 - three weeks after premiere. With natural viewership decay and Volume 2 not releasing until Dec 25, the show will likely still be #1 but the 95.8% price overestimates certainty. However, edge is insufficient for NO trade.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (13% edge \u00d7 ~$0.62 payout per dollar)\nReasoning: Leverkusen hosts K\u00f6ln at home with a dominant 4-1-0 head-to-head record in last 5 meetings. Despite recent inconsistency (loss to Augsburg, draw with Newcastle), they're the significantly superior team facing a struggling K\u00f6ln side. Home advantage at BayArena plus historical dominance suggests 75% win probability, creating 13% edge over market.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (on KK Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 82%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: +8.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive but below threshold\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda is significantly stronger (9-5 record, 3rd place) vs Partizan (5-9 record, 16th place). However, Partizan won their last meeting 89-77 in November 2024, showing they can compete in this rivalry. The 8% edge exists but falls short of the 10% minimum threshold for trade recommendation.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY:**\n- **TRADE: Market 2 (Leverkusen) - YES** (13% edge meets criteria)\n- **NO TRADE: Markets 1 and 3** (insufficient edge)",
