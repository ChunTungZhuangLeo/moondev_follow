On December 10, Ukrainian sea drones struck and disabled the Dashan tanker, a vessel from Russia's \"shadow fleet,\" as it traversed Ukraine's exclusive economic zone toward Novorossiysk. The attack inflicted critical damage to the tanker, which was operating without its transponders and at maximum speed. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-disables-shadow-fleet-vessel-with-sea-drones-black-sea-2025-12-10/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis incident marks the third such strike in two weeks, following similar attacks on the Kairos and Virat tankers. These vessels are part of a network of unregulated ships aiding Russia in exporting oil, thereby funding its military operations in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) has stated that these actions aim to reduce Russia's petrodol...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Thailand capture Preah Vihear temple by Dec 31?\nRecent trade: $886.42 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-thailand-capture-preah-vihear-temple-by-dec-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Thailand will capture the Preah Vihear temple by December 31. The temple, located in Cambodia, has been under Cambodian sovereignty since a 1962 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Vihear?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent developments indicate escalating tensions between Thailand and Cambodia along their disputed border, particularly near the Preah Vihear temple. On December 12, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to renew a ceasefire following recent deadly border clashes. However, hostilities continued along the border, with both Thai and Cambodian authorities disputing the ceasefire agreement. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8c7dd464da0c8914e07c7e1146a9ce8c?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe conflict has intensified, with Thailand launching airstrikes along the border, resulting in casualties and displacement o...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

Overall, two markets show clear agreement while the third remains contentious due to conflicting interpretations of recent attack frequency.",

Despite Crystal Palace's recent good form, it is unlikely they will overcome Manchester City's strength.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Although Ukraine has targeted Russian tankers recently, predicting another strike by December 19 is uncertain. The ongoing tensions and recent history of attacks suggest it is possible, but without more specific intelligence or patterns, the outcome remains unpredictable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The historical context of the ICJ ruling in favor of Cambodia and the current diplomatic efforts, including a ceasefire agreement, make it unlikely that Thailand will capture the Preah Vihear temple by December 31, despite ongoing border tensions.",

City are historically dominant against Palace and remain favorites even at Selhurst Park.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Ukraine has already struck three tankers in two weeks (Dashan on Dec 10, plus Kairos and Virat earlier), demonstrating an active campaign against Russia's shadow fleet. With 6 days remaining until Dec 19, the pattern suggests another strike is highly probable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite escalating border tensions and recent clashes, capturing a UNESCO World Heritage site under Cambodian sovereignty per ICJ ruling would be an extreme act of war. A ceasefire is being negotiated, and there's no indication Thailand intends full military capture within 18 days.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Crystal Palace shows good recent form with wins over Fulham and Shelbourne, Manchester City remains a significantly stronger team despite any recent challenges. The home advantage helps Palace, but City's quality makes this too uncertain for a confident position either way.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite Ukraine's recent intensification of Black Sea tanker strikes (3 attacks in two weeks including the Dashan on Dec 10), there are only 6 days remaining until the Dec 19 deadline. The recent large bet on \"No\" ($1,626) suggests informed traders believe the short timeframe makes another strike unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The ICJ ruled Preah Vihear belongs to Cambodia in 1962, and despite recent border tensions and a disputed ceasefire, there is zero credible evidence of Thailand attempting to capture the temple. Military conflict at the border does not equate to territorial seizure of this internationally-recognized Cambodian site within 18 days.",

Betting on Crystal Palace to win at a high implied probability against such an opponent is risky.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Ukraine has significantly intensified its maritime operations, striking three tankers in the Black Sea in the last two weeks, with the most recent attack on December 10. Given this high frequency and stated intent to disrupt Russian oil exports, it is highly probable they will attempt another strike by December 19.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Preah Vihear temple is under Cambodian sovereignty by international law, and the news explicitly states there is no credible evidence suggesting Thailand will capture it by December 31, calling it \"highly unlikely\" due to severe diplomatic repercussions. Despite ongoing border hostilities, capture remains an improbable outcome.",
