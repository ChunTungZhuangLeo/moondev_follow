  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no trade for Market 1 due to low edge, unanimous agreement to bet against T1 in Market 2 given an overvalued price, and mixed signals for Market 3 with two models seeing insufficient edge. All models agree the market price for marijuana rescheduling is too high, and they consistently find a significant edge in betting against T1. The primary disagreement centers on whether the edge against Google's AI leadership is large enough to warrant a trade.",
