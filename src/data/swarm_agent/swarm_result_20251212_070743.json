  "consensus_summary": "Consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with most analysts recommending a \"NO\" bet due to a projected FDV far below the $10B threshold. For Market 1, opinions vary on the true probability, resulting in no clear trade recommendation as edges are generally below the 10% threshold. Regarding Market 3, there is disagreement on the direction, but agreement that the edge is too small for a recommended trade.",

Home advantage gives slight edge, but Real Sociedad's form is poor.

This appears to be displaying the NO price. Analysts estimate Lighter launching at ~$4.5B FDV (10% of Hyperliquid). Reaching $10B would require extraordinary hype beyond what's realistic for a perp DEX. The true probability of exceeding $10B is very low (~3%).\n\n**CORRECTION - Re-reading the market:**\nIf 97.1% is the YES price, this is massively mispriced. If it's showing NO at 97.1% (YES at 2.9%), that aligns with fundamentals.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 2.9% (YES side)\nEdge: ~0%\nReasoning: Market correctly prices very low odds of $10B+ FDV.
