Recent U.S. actions, including the seizure of the oil tanker Skipper off Venezuela's coast on December 10, 2025, and the imposition of sanctions on Maduro's relatives and associated entities, suggest a continued adversarial stance toward Maduro's government.

([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-pardon-maduro-by-december-31?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven these developments and the current political climate, it appears unlikely that President Trump will pardon Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by the end of the year.\n\n\n## U.S....\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Games Total: O/U 3.5\nRecent trade: $500.00 on Under\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/lol-dk-hle1-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe \"Over/Under 3.5\" bet in sports wagering involves predicting whether the total number of goals, points, or games in a match will be over or under a set threshold of 3.5. This type of bet is prevalent in sports like soccer, basketball, and hockey.\n\n**Understanding Over/Under 3.5 Bets:**\n\n- **Over 3.5:** The bet wins if the total number of goals, points, or games is four or more.\n- **Under 3.5:** The bet wins if the total is three or fewer.\n\n**Recent Examples:**\n\nIn the NHL, several games have recently concluded with totals over 3.5:\n\n- On December 9, 2025, the Colorado Avalanche (COL) played against the Nashville Predators (NSH), resulting in a final score of COL 3 - NSH 4.\n- On December 10, 2025, the Detroit Red Wings (DET) faced the Calgary Flames (CGY), ending with a score of DET 4 - CGY 3.\n\nThese outcomes indicate that the total goals in these matches exceeded 3.5.\n\n**Factors Influencing Over/Under 3.5 Bets:**\n\n- **Team Performance:** Teams with strong offensive capabilities and ...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Anthropic have the best AI model for coding at the end of 2025?\nRecent trade: $1,162.60 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/which-company-will-have-the-best-ai-model-for-coding-at-the-end-of-2025\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 12, 2025, Anthropic has made significant advancements in AI models for coding, positioning itself as a strong contender in the field. In September 2025, the company introduced Claude Sonnet 4.5, which demonstrated the ability to autonomously code for up to 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks, surpassing the previous seven-hour capability of Claude Opus 4. ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/anthropic-says-new-ai-model-can-code-on-its-own-for-30-hours-straight?utm_source=openai)) This model achieved a 77.2% score on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, leading the industry in coding tasks. ([arstechnica.com](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-maintained-focus-for-30-hours-on-multistep-tasks/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn October 2025, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, a smaller, faster model optimized for low latency and cost, delivering near-frontier coding quality.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: Given the recent U.S. actions against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, such as the seizure of an oil tanker and the imposition of sanctions, along with the extremely low probability of a pardon indicated by the prediction market, it is highly unlikely that President Trump will pardon Maduro by December 31, 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The context provided does not specify which sport or event the \"Games Total: O/U 3.5\" market refers to, making it difficult to accurately assess the likelihood of the outcome.
