Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the seizure, stating that the tanker was used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0a148ba01684fc6ce1a228dd276732c0?utm_source=openai))\n\nVenezuela's government condemned the action as \"blatant theft\" and \"an act of international piracy,\" accusing the U.S. of seeking to appropriate the country's natural resources....\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

This creates uncertainty, making it difficult to confidently predict the outcome of this match.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Given the recent seizure of a Venezuela-linked oil ship by U.S. forces and the ongoing geopolitical tensions, there is a plausible scenario where another similar action could occur within 2025, supporting a bet on \"Yes\" for this market.",

While Tundra won 5 of their last 5 matches, Liquid's direct dominance in the latest encounter and strong current performance gives them the edge in this BO3.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The U.S. just seized the oil tanker *Skipper* on December 10, 2025, demonstrating active enforcement against Venezuela-linked vessels.
