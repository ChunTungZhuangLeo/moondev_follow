At home, WBA has some advantage, but Sheffield's momentum is strong. The 60% market price seems roughly fair given home advantage vs. away form. Insufficient edge to justify a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 98%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: +2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Minimal positive\nReasoning: Trump has already publicly announced plans to name board members \"early next year\" (2025), and the board is authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 2803. With Trump chairing it himself and calling it \"legendary,\" establishment in 2025 is nearly certain.
