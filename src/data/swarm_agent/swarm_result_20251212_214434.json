However, being in the Top 10 doesn't guarantee #1 position. The sharp decline and competition from other shows creates some uncertainty, but not enough to justify a NO bet at these odds.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 62%\nEdge: +10%\nExpected Value: +10% \u00d7 0.61 = +6.1% return on YES\n\nReasoning: Leverkusen is playing at home (BayArena) against K\u00f6ln, who are typically a weaker side. Despite the recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg, Leverkusen remains a top Bundesliga team. Home advantage in a derby-type match against a lower-ranked opponent historically yields ~70-75% win probability.

However, by Dec 16, the show will be in its third week post-release, likely facing further natural decline. The 95.8% price seems slightly high for a third week, but not enough edge to justify a NO position.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +13.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+13% \u00d7 potential payout)\nReasoning: Leverkusen plays at home (BayArena) against relegation-battling K\u00f6ln in the Bundesliga. Despite the recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg, Leverkusen remains a top-tier Bundesliga side, while K\u00f6ln has struggled significantly. Home advantage plus quality differential suggests 75%+ win probability, creating significant edge against the 62% market price.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (on Crvena Zvezda)\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: +11.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+11% \u00d7 potential payout)\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has superior form and roster strength compared to Partizan (5-9 record, 16th place). Partizan is in coaching turmoil with potential Obradovic replacement by Pe\u00f1arroya mid-season. Despite the derby atmosphere, the combination of Partizan's poor record, coaching instability, and Zvezda's better performance creates 85%+ probability for Zvezda victory.",
