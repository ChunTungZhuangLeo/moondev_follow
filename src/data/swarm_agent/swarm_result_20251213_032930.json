Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet activity between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been active in estimating his tweeting behavior during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been trading on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market with the highest trading volume focuses on the range of 360-379 tweets, with a 12.1% chance of occurring. Other ranges, such as 400-419 and 420-439 tweets, have slightly lower probabilities. Notably, the range of 280-299 tweets has a 5% chance, indicating that some participants anticipate Musk posting between 280 and 299 tweets during this period.

Team Spirit has demonstrated strong performances throughout the tournament, notably leading Stage 3 in viewership with an average of 560,700 viewers per match.

This means that if the combined goals are 3 or more, the \"Over\" bet wins; if there are 2 or fewer goals, the \"Under\" bet wins.\n\n**Recent Trends and Data:**\n\n- **Major League Soccer (MLS):** Out of 538 games played this season, 315 had over 2.5 goals, accounting for 58.6% of matches.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a severe mispricing in Market 1, with all AIs estimating a true probability near 5% against an 85.2% market price, though some disagree on trading it due to data uncertainty. For Market 2, there is strong agreement that Team Spirit is undervalued, with most recommending a YES trade based on their tournament performance. Regarding Market 3, opinions are split, leading to no clear trading consensus as the edge is either below or too close to the 10% threshold.",

The 85.2% price shown appears to be a data error or different market interpretation - Musk typically tweets far more than 280-299 per week based on his historical patterns.\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +13%\nExpected Value: +13% \u00d7 3.45 = +44.9% ROI\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after beating Falcons 2-0, meaning they're 2 wins from victory. With only 4 teams remaining, baseline probability is 25%, but their strong form (highest viewership, clean quarterfinal win) and pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (implying ~18% pre-tournament) suggest they should be closer to 40%+ now that they've reached semis.\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2%\nExpected Value: Negligible\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (Team Spirit vs Vitality based on URL), not soccer. CS2 matches are typically best-of-3, and without specific team form data for this matchup, the 50/50 pricing seems reasonable. The web search provided irrelevant soccer data.

The 85.2% price appears to be an error or misread - this should be trading around 5%.

They defeated Falcons 2-0 and were pre-tournament favorites at 5.50 odds (~18% implied). Being one match away from winning with strong form suggests 40-50% win probability, significantly higher than the 29% market price.\n\n**Decision: YES** (16% edge - market undervaluing their semifinal position)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 50%\n**Market Price:** 50.0%\n**Edge:** 0% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Zero\n**Reasoning:** This appears to be Team Spirit vs Vitality CS2 match on Dec 13.
