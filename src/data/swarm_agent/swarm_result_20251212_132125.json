  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear trade opportunity on Market 2 (BIG vs. Sangal), with four of five AIs calculating a significant positive edge for BIG, recommending a \"YES\" bet. For Market 1 (NBA O/U), opinions are split between a small edge or no trade, indicating low confidence, while all analysts agree Market 3 is overpriced and advise against a \"YES\" bet. The actionable summary is to trade on BIG in Market 2 and avoid the others due to insufficient or negative edge.",

However, their recent H2H games (99-98 and 120-112) averaged only 214.5 points, suggesting defensive matchups.

Sangal is a tier-2 team that BIG should be favored against in a BO3 format. The market at 48% implies a coin flip, which significantly undervalues BIG's structural advantages and experience.

However, their recent matchups were UNDER (99-98 and 120-112 = 219 and 232 total). The edge is just below my 10% threshold for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Counter-Strike BIG vs Sangal (BO3)\n\n**Your Probability: 42%**\n**Market Price: 48%**\n**Edge: -6%** (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value: Insufficient edge**\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n**Reasoning:** BIG is ranked #53 globally with 3/5 recent wins and strong map-specific performance (59% on Train/Dust2). However, Sangal's recent form is unknown from the context. The 6% edge toward Sangal isn't sufficient for a confident NO bet, especially in esports where variance is high.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Will Israel strike Lebanon on December 13?\n\n**Your Probability: 85%**\n**Market Price: 79.3%**\n**Edge: +5.7%** (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value: Marginal**\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n**Reasoning:** Israel conducted multiple airstrikes on December 12 (today) targeting Hezbollah facilities, representing ongoing ceasefire violations. The pattern strongly suggests continued strikes tomorrow. However, the 5.7% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold, and the recent $1,000 NO trade suggests smart money may know something about potential restraint.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n**Recommended Trades: 0 of 3**\n\nAll three markets show edge below the 10% threshold required for high-conviction trades. Market 1 (O/U 233.5) came closest at +9% favoring OVER, but recent defensive trends and low-scoring head-to-heads create uncertainty. Market 3 has strong directional conviction (85% YES) but insufficient edge given recent large NO positions.",
