      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite strong investor confidence highlighted by the $43 million Series A funding led by a16z, the current information suggests the recent trade is below $600M, and reaching the $600M mark appears ambitious given the early stage of the public sale and market conditions. The fully diluted valuation's wide range also indicates uncertainty in achieving such a target.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The New York Islanders have demonstrated strong recent performance, winning four of their last five games, and showing resilience against tough opponents. Despite some injury challenges, their momentum and recent victories suggest they can cover a -1.5 spread against their upcoming opponent.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: North Dakota State Bison has been performing exceptionally well, winning seven of their last eight games, including a significant victory over CSU Bakersfield last year. The Roadrunners' recent heavy loss to UCSB further underscores the Bison's likelihood of winning the upcoming game, making a bet on the Roadrunners less favorable.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The Gensyn public sale has an FDV range of $100M-$1B with only 3% of tokens (300M) being sold. To reach $600M in commitments would require extremely high demand at the upper valuation range, which seems unlikely for a project still in testnet phase despite strong VC backing.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While the Islanders are in good form (4-1 in last 5), covering a -1.5 spread requires winning by 2+ goals. The Ducks, despite being weaker, often play tight games, and the Islanders have key defensive injuries (Romanov out). The recent large trade on Islanders suggests value may now be on the other side.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: North Dakota State (7-3) has strong recent form including a dominant 94-60 win over this same Bakersfield team last December, while Bakersfield (4-6) just lost badly 109-84. However, the recent $1,560 trade on Bakersfield despite these fundamentals suggests possible insider knowledge or line movement I can't verify.",

Reaching $600M in commitments would require extraordinary oversubscription that seems unlikely, but without clear data on current commitment levels or auction mechanics, this is too uncertain to trade confidently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While the Islanders are hot (4-1 in last 5 games), covering a -1.5 spread requires winning by 2+ goals. Against Anaheim, who can be competitive at home, and with the Islanders dealing with injury issues (Romanov out), a 2-goal margin is too demanding for a road game despite their recent form.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: North Dakota State has strong momentum (7-3, won 7 of last 8) and dominated CSU Bakersfield 94-60 in their last meeting. However, this is a road game in Bakersfield where home court advantage matters significantly in college basketball.
