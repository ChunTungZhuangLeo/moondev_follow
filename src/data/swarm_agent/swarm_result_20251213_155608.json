This line is set to determine if the fight will extend beyond the first half of the second round.\n\n**Understanding O/U 1.5 Rounds Betting:**\n\n- **Over 1.5 Rounds:** The fight must last beyond 2 minutes and 30 seconds of the second round.\n- **Under 1.5 Rounds:** The fight must conclude before or at 2 minutes and 29 seconds of the second round.\n\nThis betting format is prevalent in MMA, where bouts are typically scheduled for three rounds, and in boxing, where fights can range from four to twelve rounds. The 1.5-round line is often used to gauge the expected duration of a fight based on the fighters' styles and histories.\n\n**Recent Context and Considerations:**\n\n- **Fighter Styles:** Fighters known for aggressive, knockout-oriented approaches may have shorter fights, leading to a higher l\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Dota 2: Team Liquid vs Virtus.pro - Game 2 Winner\nCurrent Market Price: 88.5% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,062.76 on Team Liquid\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/dota2-liquid-vp-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Team Liquid and Virtus.pro are set to face each other in a Best of 3 series during the Group Stage of DreamLeague Season 27.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no trades with a 10%+ edge, as all models agree Market 1's price is efficient and Market 3's is overvalued. There is notable disagreement only on Market 2, where AI #1 sees a 15% edge for \"Over\" while others find it insufficient or unclear. Overall, the analysis suggests passing on all three markets given the lack of a clear, high-conviction opportunity.",
