  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends a YES trade on Market 1, with most models estimating a 78-85% true probability for exceeding 2100 measles cases, yielding a significant 16-23% edge over the 62% market price. For Markets 2 and 3, opinions are split or show insufficient edge, leading to a general \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation due to either disagreement or minimal value. Overall, the only clear, actionable trade with a >10% edge is buying YES on the measles cases market.",

The current outbreak is accelerating with 47 active outbreaks across 43 states, and South Carolina alone added 126 cases recently.
