Despite initial claims of strong demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" program was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to attract affluent individuals and generate substantial revenue for the U.S. Treasury. ([kpbs.org](https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2025/02/25/trump-introduces-a-green-card-for-the-rich-the-gold-card?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Sales Performance:**\nIn March 2025, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reported the sale of 1,000 Gold Cards in a single day, each priced at $5 million. This led to projections that selling one million cards could generate $5 trillion for the U.S. government.

([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/maduro-travels-outside-venezuela-by-march-31?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **U.S. Pressure and Military Actions:** The U.S. has intensified pressure on Maduro, labeling his government a \"cocaine-smuggling syndicate.\" Military actions have escalated, including the destruction of alleged drug boats and the seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela. ([time.com](https://time.com/7340252/venezuela-oil-tanker-trump-machado-maduro/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Opposition's Stance:** Maria Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader and recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has called for a peaceful transition of power, emphasizing that Maduro will leave office, whether through negotiation or other means.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2 is severely mispriced, with most analysts recommending a \"NO\" bet due to confirmed sales contradicting the market's high probability for zero sales. For Market 1, analysts largely agree there is no significant edge, deeming the spread a fair coin flip. Opinions on Market 3 are split between a \"YES\" bet due to political pressure and a \"NO_TRADE,\" indicating higher uncertainty and a lack of clear consensus.",

This is essentially a coin flip spread, and the market is pricing it reasonably.

This directly contradicts the \"0 Gold Cards sold\" condition. Unless there's a technicality about what counts as a \"sale,\" this market should resolve NO since cards have already been sold.

Maduro has survived previous crises, controls the military, and has ~3.5 months remaining. The search context itself mentions another Polymarket showing only 31% chance of departure. The 61% market price seems overly optimistic about regime change occurring this quickly. Historical precedent strongly favors incumbent autocrats maintaining power.",
