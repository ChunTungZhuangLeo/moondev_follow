In their most recent game, they dominated the Phoenix Suns with a 138-89 victory, tying the best 25-game start in NBA history at 24-1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the team with 28 points and eight assists, while Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams added 24 and 15 points, respectively.

([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/17/2000-tariff-dividend-trump-check-2026?utm_source=openai)) However, this plan faces several challenges:\n\n- **Revenue Shortfall**: Analysts estimate that the proposed $2,000 payments would cost approximately $600 billion annually. In contrast, current tariffs are projected to generate about $200 to $300 billion per year, indicating a significant funding gap. ([fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/trump-tariff-dividend-2000-math-doesn-work/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Legal Uncertainty**: The Supreme Court is reviewing the administration's authority to impose these tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). An adverse ruling could invalidate the tariffs and eliminate the anticipated revenue for the dividends.

However, they are coming off a dominant third quarter against the San Antonio Spurs, where they outscored the Spurs 44-25. Donovan Mitchell led the team with 28 points in that game. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/basketball/cavaliers-use-big-3rd-quarter-overcome-spurs--flm-2025-12-06/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Wizards:** The Wizards have the worst defense and point differential in the NBA and are tied for the fewest wins in the league.

For Market 1 (Spurs vs. Thunder), most models see a slight edge for the Thunder but deem it insufficient for a trade, while opinions on Market 3 (Cavaliers spread) are split between a strong \"Yes\" and a \"No Trade.\" Overall, only Market 2 presents a unified, high-conviction recommendation.",

The news clearly states the dividend checks are proposed for \"mid-2026,\" not 2025. Additionally, there's a massive $300-400B annual funding gap, and the Supreme Court is reviewing tariff authority.

A 14.5-point spread is massive, and road games often see tighter margins. The Cavs should win but covering 14.5 is a coin flip at best.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE",
