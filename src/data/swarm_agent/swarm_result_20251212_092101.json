      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Elon Musk's Twitter activity is high, the impact of the reported cyberattack on platform stability could affect his tweeting frequency. The recent trading sentiment and market odds also suggest uncertainty, making it difficult to confidently predict the exact tweet range.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Union Berlin's recent poor form, including consecutive losses and a significant defeat, contrasts with RB Leipzig's strong performance, particularly their 6-0 win. Given these conditions, a draw seems unlikely, despite historical head-to-head results.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite increased U.S. military presence near Venezuela, there is no indication of an intention to deploy forces directly within the country by December 31. The focus appears to be on strategic positioning and regional influence rather than on-the-ground deployment.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: With only a 9% implied probability and the wide distribution of possible tweet ranges, this specific 320-339 bucket is unlikely to hit exactly. Musk's activity is high but unpredictable, and the cyberattack on X could disrupt his posting patterns.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: RB Leipzig is in dominant form (6-0 win recently) while Union Berlin has lost three consecutive matches. The form disparity suggests Leipzig is more likely to win outright than draw, despite 2 draws in the last 5 head-to-head meetings.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite increased military presence and tensions near Venezuela, actual deployment of US forces INTO Venezuela by December 31 remains highly unlikely. Military positioning for deterrence/drug interdiction is very different from an actual incursion, which would be a major escalation requiring Congressional involvement.",

While Elon Musk's activity is high, a cyberattack on X could also impact his ability to tweet consistently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: RB Leipzig is in strong form with a recent 6-0 victory, while 1. FC Union Berlin has struggled with three consecutive losses. This significant disparity in recent performance makes a draw less likely than a Leipzig win, despite the market pricing \"Yes\" at $600.00.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The news indicates a significant increase in US military presence *near* Venezuela and in the Caribbean, including the reactivation of a base in Puerto Rico and naval deployments. However, there is no information suggesting US forces will be *in* Venezuela itself by December 31, which implies a direct intervention not supported by the context.",

Without current tweet count data for the period, this narrow range is too speculative.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Leipzig is in exceptional form (6-0 win over Frankfurt) while Union Berlin has lost three consecutive matches. Leipzig's strong attack against Union's poor recent defensive record makes a Leipzig win more likely than a draw.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite increased U.S. military presence near Venezuela (F-35s in Puerto Rico, naval deployments), these are positioning moves in the region, not deployments into Venezuela itself. Actual invasion or troop deployment into Venezuelan territory by December 31 would require congressional authorization and represents an extreme escalation unlikely within 19 days.",
