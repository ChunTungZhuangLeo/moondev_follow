Regarding Anthropic, two models predict \"Yes\" based on Claude's strong benchmarks, while one predicts \"No\" citing competition and a large opposing trade. For the hockey game, predictions are divided between \"Over\" due to Montreal's high-scoring trend and \"Under\" because of New York's strong defense and low offense, indicating significant uncertainty.",

Despite the Rangers' stronger defense, the Canadiens' ability to score and the historical data of high-scoring games suggest that the total goals will likely exceed 5.5.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: FanDuel and CME Group have announced a partnership to launch a prediction markets platform by December 2025. Given the detailed plans and the scheduled launch, it is reasonable to predict that FanDuel will successfully launch prediction markets with CME by the end of the year.",
