  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for West Bromwich Albion winning and \"YES\" for Trump nominating Kevin Warsh, based directly on recent form and explicit statements. For the EuroLeague match, opinions are split between \"NO\" for Partizan and \"NO_TRADE,\" with disagreement on whether Crvena Zvezda's recent close wins are sufficient for a confident prediction. Overall, the AI models show high agreement on two markets but caution regarding the basketball game due to incomplete context and rivalry volatility.",

Given these outcomes, betting against Partizan in their upcoming matchup seems prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: President Trump has explicitly indicated Kevin Warsh as one of his top candidates for the Fed chair position, and he is reportedly leaning towards nominating either Warsh or Hassett. This makes a Warsh nomination a plausible outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: West Bromwich Albion's recent decline in form, coupled with Sheffield United's six-game unbeaten run, suggests that West Bromwich Albion is less likely to win their upcoming match. Consequently, betting on West Bromwich Albion to win does not seem wise.",

The recent trade heavily favoring Partizan may present value on the other side given Zvezda's dominance in head-to-head matches.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES**\nReasoning: Trump has explicitly stated he is \"leaning toward Warsh or Hassett\" for Fed chair, with Warsh being a former Fed Governor and frequently mentioned as a top candidate since August 2025. With only two names in serious contention and Warsh's stronger Fed credentials, there's reasonable probability he gets the nomination.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO**\nReasoning: West Brom has won only 2 of their last 10 matches and dropped to 16th place, while Sheffield United is on a 6-game unbeaten run under Chris Wilder.

The recent trade favors Partizan, but without complete information about current form, injuries, or home court advantage, this rivalry match is too unpredictable for confident positioning.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Trump explicitly stated in a December 12, 2025 WSJ interview that he is \"leaning toward Warsh or Hassett\" for Fed chair, with Warsh being mentioned first. This recent, direct statement from Trump significantly increases the probability of Warsh's nomination compared to other candidates.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: West Bromwich Albion has won only 2 of their last 10 matches and sits 16th in the standings, while Sheffield United is on a six-game unbeaten run under Chris Wilder. Analysts predict a draw as most likely, and Sheffield United's superior current form makes a West Brom win unlikely.",
