Recent developments provide insight into his campaign and the political landscape:\n\n**Political Climate and Election Outlook**\n\n- **Polls and Predictions**: A recent survey by the N\u00e9z\u0151pont Institute indicates that 50% of Hungarians believe Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n will win the 2026 election, with Magyar trailing at 32%. ([hungarianconservative.com](https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/current/new-poll-viktor-orban-election-2026-donald-trump-hungary/?utm_source=openai)) However, Barclays analysts suggest that if the opposition wins, the Hungarian forint could appreciate by up to 5.5%.

On December 24, 2024, the song set a new record with 24.86 million streams, surpassing its previous record of 23.7 million streams on the same day in 2023. ([yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mariah-carey-want-christmas-hits-142257737.html?utm_source=openai)) This trend underscores the track's enduring popularity and its status as a holiday staple.\n\nIn 2025, Bad Bunny reclaimed the title of Spotify's most-streamed artist globally, surpassing Taylor Swift, who had held the top spot in 2023 and 2024. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fb021e2387d6aff7e4d8353a067f1664?utm_source=openai)) However, despite this shift, Carey's holiday classic remains a dominant force during the Christmas season.\n\nGiven these patterns, it's highly probable that \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" will be Spotify's top song on December 25, 2025, continuing its tradition of le...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Spread: UMBC Retrievers (-7.5)\nRecent trade: $1,469.00 on Army Black Knights\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/cbb-army-umbc-2025-12-12\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe UMBC Retrievers men's basketball team is currently 6-4 for the 2025\u201326 season, with a 0-0 record in the America East Conference.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for P\u00e9ter Magyar becoming Hungary's next Prime Minister due to his significant polling deficit against Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and unanimously predicts \"YES\" for Mariah Carey's song topping Spotify on Christmas given its record-breaking trend. There is notable disagreement only on Market 1, where one model recommended \"NO_TRADE\" due to election timing, but the overwhelming agreement is \"NO.\" For the UMBC vs. Army basketball spread, all models agree on \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient or unclear data, making it the only market without a clear directional prediction.",

This suggests that betting on Magyar becoming the next Prime Minister of Hungary may not be the most favorable position given the current odds and predictions.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has consistently topped Spotify's charts during the holiday season, recently setting a new streaming record. Given its historical performance and enduring popularity, it is highly probable that the song will again be Spotify's top song on December 25, 2025.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The UMBC Retrievers have shown variability in their performance, with recent games displaying both victories and losses.
