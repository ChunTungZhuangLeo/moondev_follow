The 97.5% price accurately reflects that this has already happened - the announcement itself constitutes \"creating\" a tariff dividend.

The Cavs have lost 5 of their last 7 games showing inconsistency, and even dominant teams often fail to cover double-digit spreads against NBA competition. The Wizards' 13-game losing streak to Cleveland increases blowout risk, but 14.5 points is still a significant margin that teams frequently fail to cover even in mismatches.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -12.9%\nExpected Value: +12.9% \u00d7 3.12 = +40% ROI on NO bet\nReasoning: 9INE has a 20% win rate in the past month and a six-match losing streak on Ancient, plus they're integrating two new players which typically disrupts team chemistry. SPARTA has 58% win rate recently and momentum from qualifier victories. The market is overvaluing 9INE significantly given their current form struggles and roster changes.",
