  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows agreement on BetBoom Team being a slight favorite in Market 1, but all models either advise against trading or show an edge below the 10% threshold.

Regarding Market 3, there is sharp disagreement on the correct \"Yes\" or \"No\" position, indicating high uncertainty and a lack of clear consensus.",

Wicked already had its opening weekend on Nov 21, 2025. This is essentially a certainty - Avatar cannot have an opening weekend if it hasn't released.
