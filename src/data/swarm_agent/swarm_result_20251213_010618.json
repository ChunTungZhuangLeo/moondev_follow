  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows a clear disagreement on the Jaguars spread, with models split between a \"YES\" trade and \"NO_TRADE,\" reflecting uncertainty around covering such a large NFL point total. For the Maine Senate primary, opinions are sharply divided between \"YES\" and \"NO\" positions, indicating high uncertainty and no clear edge emerges from the collective analysis. Only the Barcelona vs. Osasuna market shows unanimous agreement that \"NO\" is overvalued, but no model finds a +10% edge to recommend a trade on the opposite side.",

Given the Jets' significant quarterback issues, the Jaguars are likely to cover the spread.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 55%  \nMarket Price: 60.0%  \nEdge: -5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -5% (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)  \nReasoning: Although Graham Platner has shown strong polling numbers, controversies surrounding his past remarks may hinder his chances.

However, 13.5 points is a large spread even against a bad team. NFL games rarely see spreads this large covered consistently. The market seems fairly priced given the circumstances.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Graham Platner be the Democratic nominee for Senate in Maine?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 60%\nEdge: -15%\nExpected Value: ~37.5% return on NO bet\nReasoning: While Platner has progressive support and one favorable poll showing a 20-point lead, Janet Mills has secured major establishment endorsements (abortion-rights groups, EMILYs List) and is the sitting Governor with institutional advantages. The tattoo controversy creates downside risk for Platner. Establishment candidates typically prevail in Democratic primaries, and Mills' endorsement momentum suggests the market is overvaluing Platner's chances.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will CA Osasuna win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 10%\nMarket Price: 93%\nEdge: -83%\nExpected Value: This appears to be a market ERROR - Osasuna is playing AWAY at Barcelona\nReasoning: This market seems mispriced or mislabeled. Barcelona is the heavy favorite at home (leading LaLiga with 40 points, 6-game win streak). Osasuna winning at Camp Nou against league leaders would be a major upset. If the question is genuinely \"Will Osasuna win?\", the true probability is around 10%, making NO an extremely strong bet. However, verify the market resolution criteria first.",

Jets are decimated at QB (Taylor and Fields both injured), which supports the large spread. However, 13.5-point spreads hit around 48-50% historically, and the market at 52% is roughly efficient.

Osasuna winning away at the league leaders has maybe 5-10% probability. The market has this completely backwards at 93% - this is likely YES on Osasuna when it should be single digits.
