Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Theo's FDV will be above $700 million one day after launch.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While the 76ers have shown strong recent performances, the Hawks are slightly favored in the upcoming game. The close nature of the match and the betting lines suggest uncertainty, making it a less favorable market to take a definitive position on either team.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Both teams have been scoring and conceding goals at a rate indicating a likelihood of both teams scoring. Getafe CF averages 2.4 goals per game, and Espanyol averages 1.0 goal scored per game, suggesting that both teams are capable of scoring in this match.",
