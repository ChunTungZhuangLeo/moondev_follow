  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Markets 1 and 2 offer insufficient edge for a recommended trade, with most AIs seeing them as near coin-flips. There is significant disagreement on Market 3, with most AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade due to high perceived probability from recent events, but one dissenting view argues the market price is already too high. Overall, only Market 3 generates a consistent trade recommendation from the majority, based on an assessed edge exceeding 10%.",

While Detroit averages 118.7 PPG, that game suggests defensive intensity in this matchup. The 233.5 line requires both teams to score ~117 points each, which seems unlikely given recent head-to-head evidence.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Counter-Strike: BIG vs Sangal (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 48%\nEdge: +14%\nExpected Value: 14% \u00d7 1.08 = +15.1% ROI on YES (BIG)\nReasoning: BIG is ranked higher (#53 vs #59), has a 2-1 head-to-head advantage against Sangal, and both teams have identical recent form (3-2 in last 5).
