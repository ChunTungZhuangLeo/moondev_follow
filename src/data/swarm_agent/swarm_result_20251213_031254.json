      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: The Oklahoma City Thunder's dominant performance, including a 24-1 record and a recent 49-point victory over a strong team like the Phoenix Suns, suggests they are likely to cover the 9.5-point spread against the Spurs. The Spurs, while performing well, are up against a team on a historic run.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Team Spirit has shown excellent form throughout the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025, with a flawless run and strong performances from key players. Expert analyses and their high viewership suggest they have a strong chance of winning the championship.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While December trends suggest an increase in goals due to various factors, the slight decrease in the percentage of over 2.5 goals in the Premier League during this month indicates some uncertainty. Additionally, the context does not provide specific information about the teams involved in this match, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of the over outcome confidently.",

      "response": "**MARKET 1: Thunder (-9.5)**\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\nReasoning: While the Thunder are dominant at 24-1 with a 16-game win streak, the Spurs have been playing well (17-7) and have tournament momentum after beating the Lakers. NBA Cup semifinal games tend to be more competitive, and 9.5 points is a large spread for a neutral-site playoff atmosphere game.\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n**Decision: YES**\nReasoning: Team Spirit has had a flawless Stage 3 run, advanced to semi-finals after beating Team Falcons, and their star player donk is performing exceptionally.
