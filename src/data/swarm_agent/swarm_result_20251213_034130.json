Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet count between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been actively tracking and analyzing his Twitter activity during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been placing bets on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market with the highest trading volume focuses on the 280-299 tweet range, with a 5% chance of occurrence, as of December 13, 2025. Other markets with lower trading volumes also reflect similar probabilities for this range. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese odds suggest that the majority of participants anticipate Musk will post fewer than 280 tweets during this period.

Team Spirit has demonstrated strong performance throughout the tournament, securing a spot in the semifinals after defeating Team Falcons 2-0 in the quarterfinals.

Recent analyses and expert opinions provide valuable insights into strategies for approaching this market.\n\n**Understanding the Market:**\n\nIn Over/Under 2.5 goals betting, you predict whether the total goals scored in a match will be over or under 2.5. For an \"Over\" bet to win, at least three goals must be scored; for an \"Under\" bet, two or fewer goals are required. ([goalsnow.com](https://www.goalsnow.com/over-under-predictions/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Strategies for Success:**\n\n1. **Analyze Team Form and Scoring Patterns:**\n   - Teams with strong attacking records and weak defenses are prime candidates for Over 2.5 goals. For instance, matches involving high-scoring teams like Bayern Munich or Barcelona often see more than 2.5 goals.

With most participants predicting fewer tweets, a probability of 70% seems more appropriate.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nYour Probability: 45%  \nMarket Price: 29.0%  \nEdge: +16% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +16% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Team Spirit's strong performance in the tournament and high levels of fan support, combined with their position as a top contender, increase their chances of winning.

This appears to be a data display error or I'm misreading the market. Given Musk's typical posting patterns and the narrow 20-tweet window, hitting exactly 280-299 tweets is unlikely.

With only 4 teams remaining and Spirit showing excellent form, they have roughly a 40%+ chance to win two more series.

With only 3 days remaining (Dec 14-16), reaching 280-299 tweets requires 93-100 tweets per day, which is extremely unlikely even for Musk's high activity. The market is catastrophically mispriced but unclear which direction is correct due to potential data error.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE (Due to likely data error making true market direction unclear)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Your Probability:** 45%\n**Market Price:** 29.0%\n**Edge:** +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +16.0% \u00d7 2.45 payout = +39.2%\n**Reasoning:** Team Spirit is in the semifinals (top 4) with strong momentum after 2-0 quarterfinal victory, leads tournament viewership at 560K average (indicating form/popularity), and had pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15-18% implied) which undervalued them. Now in final four with one match from finals on Dec 14, their true probability is substantially higher than 29%.

Both are elite teams capable of close matches. The generic web context about O/U 2.5 goals in soccer is irrelevant. In CS2 best-of-3s, over 2.5 maps (meaning 3 maps played) occurs when teams split first two maps. Without specific team H2H data, 50-52% is approximately fair value for competitive semifinal matchup.\n\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE (Only 2% edge, below 10% threshold)",
