      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The market asks for the Game 1 winner, but the recent news explicitly states the outcome is not yet available as the match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM on December 12, 2025, and the current time is 3:17 PM. Therefore, a definitive prediction cannot be made based on the outcome.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Opendoor (OPEN) is currently trading at approximately $6.94, and analyst forecasts for December 2025 are bearish, ranging between $6.88 and $6.99, far below the $10 target. Recent negative developments, including exclusion from S&P indices, further suggest it will not reach $10 by month-end.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Donald Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run for a third term in the 2028 U.S. presidential election due to the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms.

With recent S&P index exclusion, bearish analyst forecasts ($6.88-$6.99 range), and only ~19 days remaining, this outcome is extremely unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Trump is constitutionally ineligible for a third term under the 22nd Amendment.

Analyst forecasts show bearish sentiment with projected range of $6.88-$6.99, plus recent negative catalysts including index exclusions make this highly unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The 22nd Amendment explicitly prohibits Trump from serving a third term, making this constitutionally impossible. Despite his speculation about wanting a third term, this is a clear legal barrier that cannot be overcome without a constitutional amendment (which requires 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of states).",
