Netanyahu faces ongoing legal/political pressure, Khamenei is elderly (85+), but realistically none appear imminent to leave power.

However, Ja Morant's status is questionable, and totals can be volatile. The 233.5 line is high, and while the over is likely, the 89% market price already reflects this.

Jazz are struggling this season. The Grizzlies should be favored in the first half at home. This market appears to misprice the Jazz's chances significantly - bet NO (Grizzlies 1H).",

However, Netanyahu faces ongoing political pressure and potential coalition instability, and Maduro's Venezuela remains volatile.

Even without Morant (questionable), Memphis won 7 of last 9 with strong bench production. 233.5 is achievable but edge is below 10% threshold.\n\n**NOTE: While positive edge exists, it falls short of the required 10% minimum for trade recommendation.**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: +12% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+12% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: The market is pricing Grizzlies (44% implied) to win first half, but Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games even WITHOUT Morant. If Morant returns (questionable status, practiced fully), Grizzlies' first-half dominance increases significantly.
