  "consensus_summary": "The consensus across all three AI models is that no trades meet the 10% edge threshold, with agreement that Market 1 is accurately priced as a near-certainty. There is notable disagreement on the true probabilities for the soccer matches, particularly for Market 3 where assessments range from 45% to 60%. Overall, the analysis suggests all current market prices are efficient, providing no clear high-edge trading opportunities.",
