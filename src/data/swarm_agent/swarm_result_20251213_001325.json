The National Guard \"Azov\" stated that Russian forces only control \"a small number of cartridges of several infantrymen who entered the outskirts of the city.\" ([unn.ua](https://unn.ua/en/news/occupiers-capture-of-rodynske-is-a-fake-the-city-is-under-the-control-of-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the realm of prediction markets, the \"Will Russia capture Rodynske \n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 2's \"Yes\" price is overvalued and Market 3's \"Yes\" price is also too high, with most models recommending \"No\" trades for both. For Market 1, opinions are split between \"Yes\" and \"No Trade,\" reflecting a genuine debate over whether 9INE's head-to-head record or Alliance's recent form is more predictive. Overall, the clearest recommended edges are against the current high probabilities in the political and conflict markets.",

The 43.8% market price for 9INE (implied 56.2% for Alliance) roughly reflects this recent momentum shift despite historical dominance. Edge too small to justify trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Yoon out of custody by March 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 82.0%\nEdge: -47.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong negative edge - **BET NO**\nReasoning: The market has this BACKWARDS - 82% implies release is likely, but Yoon was re-arrested in July 2025 on serious charges with court citing evidence destruction concerns. With only 3.5 months until deadline and ongoing legal proceedings for obstruction charges, a 35% release probability is generous. The original November market showed 21% which aligns better with reality.\n\n**CORRECTION: This is a BET NO opportunity (market overvalues YES at 82%)**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Will Russia capture Rodynske by December 31?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 73.0%\nEdge: -48.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Excellent negative edge - **BET NO**\nReasoning: As of Dec 13, only 18 days remain and Ukrainian sources confirm Rodynske is under their control with only \"minimal incursions\" to outskirts by Russian infantry. Azov National Guard states Russians only control \"a small number of cartridges of several infantrymen\" on outskirts - far from capturing the town. 73% market price vastly overestimates Russian capability to fully capture in 18 days.",
