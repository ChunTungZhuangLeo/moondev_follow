  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts the Nuggets will win and Fenerbah\u00e7e is favored to win, though one model dissents due to key absences. For Crystal Palace, most models predict a loss to Manchester City, but one model highlights conflicting team information and advises against trading. Overall, the predictions show high agreement on two markets with one notable disagreement on Fenerbah\u00e7e due to injury impact.",

Despite Palace's good form, Manchester City's strength makes it unlikely for Crystal Palace to win.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Fenerbah\u00e7e has been performing well, evidenced by a recent victory over Be\u015fikta\u015f. Although they have some injury concerns, their depth, including players like Talisca and En Nesyri, should help them secure a win against SK Brann.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The Denver Nuggets are in excellent form with a strong winning streak and standout performances from key players like Jamal Murray and Nikola Joki\u0107. In contrast, the Sacramento Kings are struggling significantly, making a Nuggets victory highly probable.",

Despite Palace's good form, Man City remains a formidable opponent, and Palace has key injury concerns including Matheus Cunha. The matchup favors City.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES**\nReasoning: Fenerbah\u00e7e is playing away at SK Brann in Europa League, but they've shown strong form recently including a 3-2 derby win over Be\u015fikta\u015f. Despite missing Asensio and Dur\u00e1n, they have quality depth with Talisca and En Nesyri available, and Brann is a weaker opponent.\n\n**MARKET 3: YES (Nuggets)**\nReasoning: The Nuggets (17-6) are on a three-game winning streak with Joki\u0107 and Murray in excellent form, while the Kings (6-18) have lost five of their last six games and collapsed late against Indiana. This is a significant mismatch favoring Denver strongly.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The context contains a critical error - it mentions a Manchester City vs Crystal Palace match on November 30, 2025, but references Manchester United players (Zirkzee, Mount). Crystal Palace's recent form is strong (4th place, 26 points), but without clear information about which Manchester team they're actually facing and their current form, this is too uncertain to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Fenerbah\u00e7e is facing SK Brann (a Norwegian club) in Europa League with strong recent form including a 3-2 win over Be\u015fikta\u015f. Despite missing Asensio and Dur\u00e1n, they should be heavily favored against a lower-tier European opponent at this stage of the competition.\n\nMARKET 3: YES (Nuggets)\nReasoning: Denver (17-6) is on a three-game winning streak with Joki\u0107 and Murray playing well, while Sacramento (6-18) has lost 5 of their last 6 games and showed poor late-game execution against Indiana. The record disparity and current form strongly favor the Nuggets.",
