  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong agreement to bet \"YES\" on Market 2 (PSG/Metz Over 3.5 goals) due to a consistent estimated edge above 10%, while all analysts agree Market 1 is overvalued but disagree on whether it's a \"NO\" trade or has insufficient edge. For Market 3, the consensus is that the \"Both Teams to Score\" price at 98% is too high, though analysts are split on whether the estimated probability yields a sufficient edge for a \"NO\" trade. Overall, Market 2 is the clearest recommended trade based on unanimous high conviction.",
