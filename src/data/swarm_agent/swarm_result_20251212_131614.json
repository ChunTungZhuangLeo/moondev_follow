The recent trade indicates confidence in Xtreme Gaming, and their higher world ranking supports a bet on them.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Despite the recent trade on Spirit, Vitality has consistently shown dominance over Spirit, including a recent 2-1 victory and a 3-0 sweep earlier in the year. Vitality's past performance in high-stakes matches makes them the likely winner.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The previous matchup between the Hawks and Pistons resulted in a low-scoring game of 99-98, which is significantly below the over/under line of 233.5. However, both teams have high offensive capabilities, creating uncertainty. Without clear recent trends, this market is too unpredictable.",
