      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: Angers SCO has shown relatively strong recent form, winning three of their last five matches, and they previously defeated Nantes 1-0 earlier this year. Considering Nantes' current struggles, with three consecutive losses and no wins in their last six matches, Angers is likely to win this match.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Marco Rubio has not declared his candidacy and has shown public support for JD Vance, who is currently the leading contender for the Republican nomination with substantial support in polls. Given Rubio's low poll numbers and his backing of Vance, it seems unlikely that Rubio will win the 2028 US Presidential Election.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The Portuguese presidential race appears highly competitive with no clear frontrunner. Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes is a leading candidate but is closely tied with other contenders in polls. Given the current polling data showing a tight race, it is uncertain whether Marques Mendes will win, making it a risky bet.",

The current market price for \"Yes\" seems overly optimistic given the tight and varied poll results.",

Rubio appears to be positioning himself as a supporter rather than competitor to Vance.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The polling shows a highly competitive three-way race with Marques Mendes at 16-22.6% depending on the poll, essentially tied with Gouveia e Melo and Ventura.
