  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting NO on the tariff dividend market due to a clear timeline mismatch for 2025, creating a massive edge. For the basketball games, analysts agree the Thunder are heavy favorites but see insufficient edge versus the market price, while opinions are split on the Cavaliers' spread, with only one model finding a >10% edge. Overall, the tariff dividend market is flagged as the primary actionable opportunity based on the provided analyses.",

The 81% price seems fairly accurate for a semifinal matchup - Thunder are heavy favorites but Spurs have upset potential in a single-elimination format.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge is only 1%, well below the 10% threshold needed.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -82.5%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The news explicitly states dividend payments are planned to \"begin by mid-2026,\" not 2025. Creating a tariff dividend requires Congressional appropriation, administrative infrastructure, and distribution mechanisms - none of which can realistically be completed in the remaining ~3 weeks of 2025. The market appears to be mispricing \"proposal\" vs \"creation.\"\n\n**Decision: NO** - Massive edge betting against.

The Cavs' recent struggles suggest they may win comfortably but not cover this large spread.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Exactly at 10% edge threshold, slight value on Wizards +14.5.",

They demolished the Suns 138-89. While Spurs beat Lakers to advance, Thunder's dominance suggests even higher win probability than market price. However, 7% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?\n**Your Probability:** 8%\n**Market Price:** 97.5% (NO is priced at 2.5%)\n**Edge:** -89.5% (betting NO side)\n**Expected Value:** High (89.5% \u00d7 payout)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Market is severely mispriced. Trump has only \"proposed\" $2,000 payments to begin by **MID-2026**, not 2025. The question asks about creation in 2025, but implementation timeline is 2026. With only 19 days left in 2025, there's insufficient time to establish and distribute this program. This is a strong NO bet.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Spread: Cavaliers (-14.5)\n**Your Probability:** 58%\n**Market Price:** 52%\n**Edge:** +6% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Insufficient edge\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n**Reasoning:** Cavaliers are 14.5-point favorites against the worst defensive team in the NBA (Wizards have lost 13 straight to Cleveland). However, Cavs have struggled lately (5 losses in last 7 games), creating uncertainty. The 6% edge doesn't justify a trade given the recent inconsistency, despite the favorable matchup.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** Only Market 2 (Trump Tariff Dividend) meets the 10%+ edge threshold with a strong **NO** recommendation. The market has severely mispriced the timeline - the proposal is for mid-2026 implementation, not 2025 creation.",
