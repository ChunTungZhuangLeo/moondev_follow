The company has been focusing on other AI initiatives, including the development of Llama 4 and its successor, Avocado.\n\n**Llama 4 Release and Delays**\n\nMeta unveiled Llama 4 in April 2025, introducing two variants: Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. These models are part of a multimodal system capable of processing text, audio, video, and images. Meta released them as open-source to promote transparency and collaboration in AI development. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-releases-new-ai-model-llama-4-2025-04-05/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, the release faced delays due to performance issues. Llama 4 did not meet Meta's expectations in reasoning and mathematical tasks during benchmark tests and showed limitations in voice interactions compared to models developed by OpenAI.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Market 1's \"Yes\" price is severely overvalued, with all AIs estimating a near-zero true probability, though some debate whether the remaining edge on \"No\" is worth trading. For Market 2, all models recommend \"NO_TRADE,\" seeing the game as relatively balanced and the market price as fairly efficient with no significant edge. Regarding Market 3, there is clear agreement that the draw is undervalued, with multiple AIs identifying a 10%+ edge and recommending a \"Yes\" trade based on prediction algorithms and historical data.",

With only ~19 days left in 2025 and no indication of imminent Llama 5 release, the 96.3% YES price is wildly mispriced.

However, the market is already pricing this at 96.3% NO (3.7% YES), leaving minimal edge despite being correct.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - While NO is clearly correct, the 3.7% YES price doesn't offer enough edge to justify the capital risk for such a small potential gain.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Sharks vs. Penguins**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 40.0%\nEdge: -5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Slightly negative\nReasoning: Sharks just won in OT against Toronto showing momentum, but Penguins won their previous matchup 3-0 and have home ice advantage. The Penguins are the stronger team historically, making 40% for Sharks reasonable. Edge is insufficient for either side.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Market price is fairly efficient. 5% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Will Rayo Vallecano vs. Real Betis end in a draw?**\n\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 24.0%\nEdge: +18% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +18% \u00d7 4.17x payout = +75% EV\nReasoning: Multiple prediction models (BetClan 37%, Forebet 48%) suggest draw probability significantly higher than market price. Their most recent meeting ended 2-2, and historically these fixtures are closely contested. Market is undervaluing draw probability.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge of 18% with multiple independent sources supporting higher draw probability than market implies.
