Russian forces have reportedly advanced significantly, with claims of controlling over 30% of the town's buildings. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-top-general-says-army-is-advancing-ukraine-targeting-myrnohrad-2025-12-09/?utm_source=openai)) However, Ukrainian officials dispute these claims, asserting that they still hold parts of Myrnohrad and are actively resisting Russian advances.

Combs, a prominent music mogul, was convicted in July 2025 on two counts of transportation for the purpose of prostitution and was sentenced to 50 months in prison on October 3, 2025.

For Market 2, all AIs strongly agree the 97.9% price for a \"Yes\" is severely mispriced, indicating a high-value opportunity to bet \"No,\" though they note the poor risk/reward ratio of the specific bet.

The news shows Trump was noncommittal, Diddy was convicted and sentenced, and there's been no pardon announcement with only ~19 days left in 2025.

However, market price fairly reflects the uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 2%\nMarket Price: 97.9%\nEdge: -95.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +4,750% on NO bet\nReasoning: This market is MASSIVELY mispriced - 97.9% means YES (Trump WILL pardon), but Diddy is convicted of serious sex trafficking crimes with 50-month sentence. Trump said he'd \"look at facts\" but has no political incentive to pardon a controversial figure. The recent $841 NO trade suggests smart money sees this. Market should be ~2% YES, not 98%.\n\n**CRITICAL NOTE**: Betting NO at 2.1% price means risking $98 to win $2, terrible risk/reward even with edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 60%\nMarket Price: 47.0%\nEdge: +13% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +27.7% (13% edge \u00d7 ~2.13 payout)\nReasoning: 49ers are 13.5-point favorites at home against struggling Titans. Despite key injuries to Warner/Bosa, 49ers have superior talent across the board. The -13.5 spread at 47% implies market doubts, but home favorites of this magnitude cover ~55-60% historically when talent gap is significant.\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDED TRADES:\n1. **MARKET 3 (49ers -13.5): BET YES** - Clear 13% edge with reasonable probability assessment\n2. **MARKET 2 (Trump/Diddy): BET NO** - Massive mispricing but poor risk/reward structure makes it unattractive despite huge edge",
