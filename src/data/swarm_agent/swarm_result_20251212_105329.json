On November 12, 2025, data from Polymarket indicated a 68% probability that Lighter's FDV would surpass $3 billion on the day after its launch. ([bitget.com](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605058794?utm_source=openai)) Subsequently, on December 7, 2025, the same platform reported a 72% probability for the FDV exceeding $1 billion on the day after launch, with a 67% probability for exceeding $2 billion. ([bitget.site](https://www.bitget.site/en/amp/news/detail/12560605100742?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese figures suggest a strong market expectation for Lighter's FDV to reach significant valuations shortly after its launch.

In July 2025, Rubio expressed support for Vice President J.D. Vance, stating he would be a \"great nominee\" if he decides to run.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting against Marco Rubio winning in 2028, as all models assign a very low true probability far below the market price. For the football match, opinions are split between a \"YES\" trade with a 10%+ edge and taking no position, indicating moderate confidence in Angers but no clear agreement. Regarding the Lighter token, most models advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to high uncertainty and insufficient edge, reflecting a lack of strong conviction from the analyzed data.",

Angers won the last H2H 1-0. Home advantage plus opponent's poor form justifies 65% probability.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 45%\n**Market Price:** 49.9%\n**Edge:** -4.9% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Insufficient edge\n**Reasoning:** Previous market data showed 68% probability for >$3B, but more recent data shows 67% for >$2B and 72% for >$1B, suggesting the $3B threshold is aggressive. Market sentiment appears roughly efficient at 49.9%, with insufficient edge to justify a position.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Your Probability:** 2%\n**Market Price:** 95.9%\n**Edge:** -93.9% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** +93.9% \u00d7 24.4 payout = +2,291%\n**Reasoning:** This market is SEVERELY mispriced. The question asks if Rubio will WIN the 2028 election (not just run). He's currently Secretary of State, has publicly backed J.D. Vance as the likely 2028 nominee, and there's zero indication he'll even run. A 95.9% probability of winning is absurd - this should be under 5%.",

Home advantage and Nantes' poor form (0 wins in last 5) support Angers, but 45% is my estimate for an outright win given typical Ligue 1 home win rates.

The December 7 data showed only 67% for >$2B, implying >$3B would be considerably lower.

Rubio has explicitly backed JD Vance for 2028, hasn't declared candidacy, and is focused on being Secretary of State. The 95.9% probability makes no sense - either this is a different market resolution criteria or a severe mispricing. If this truly asks if Rubio wins 2028, betting NO at 4.1% is extremely high value. **STRONG NO**",
