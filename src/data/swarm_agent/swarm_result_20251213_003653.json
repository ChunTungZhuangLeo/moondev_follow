On December 11, Russian military commanders reported to President Vladimir Putin that their forces had captured Siversk, a town in the Donetsk region. They described this as a significant step toward advancing to Sloviansk, another major city still under Ukrainian control.

In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Armed Forces stated that Siversk remains under their control, despite ongoing Russian attempts to infiltrate the area. They reported that Russian forces are trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavorable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches.

Regarding Market 3, there is sharp division, with some AIs heavily favoring \"YES\" based on Russian claims and others strongly advocating \"NO\" due to Ukrainian denials, revealing high uncertainty and conflicting interpretations of the same news.",
