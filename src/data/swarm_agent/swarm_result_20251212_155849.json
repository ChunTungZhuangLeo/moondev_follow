Prediction markets on Polymarket have low trading volumes and odds for this specific range, suggesting limited market interest or consensus on this outcome. For instance, the market for 240-259 tweets has a \"Yes\" price of 1.5%, indicating a low probability assigned by traders. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nHistorically, Elon Musk's tweet frequency has varied. In November 2025, he posted 132 tweets, averaging approximately 4.4 tweets per day. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-2025-1320-1359?utm_source=openai)) Extrapolating this average over the seven-day period from December 9 to December 16 would result in about 31 tweets, significantly fewer than the 240-259 range.\n\nGiven...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly favors \"NO\" for Market 3, based on Musk's historical tweet frequency. For the esports markets, there is significant disagreement and a prevalent \"NO_TRADE\" stance due to high volatility and insufficient real-time data, though some models lean toward Team Spirit in Market 1 and Runa Team in Market 2 based on recent form. Overall, predictions are only confident for the tweet-count market, while the match outcomes are deemed too uncertain for a clear consensus.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: Team Spirit recently defeated Team Liquid in a best-of-three series, including a win in Game 2 with a score of 60-46. Given this recent performance and their slight historical edge over Team Liquid, betting on Team Spirit to win Game 2 seems prudent.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: There is no head-to-head record between Xtreme Gaming and Runa Team, making predictions based solely on recent performance difficult. While Runa Team has a recent victory, Xtreme Gaming's recent loss could motivate a strong comeback, causing uncertainty in the outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The market assigns a very low probability to the 240-259 tweet range, and extrapolating Elon Musk's historical tweeting frequency suggests he is unlikely to post in this range during the specified period. Thus, betting on \"No\" aligns with both market sentiment and historical data.",

While Team Spirit has a slight historical edge (14-14 in 28 matches), individual game outcomes are too volatile for a confident prediction without knowing Game 1 results.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is the first encounter between these teams, making prediction difficult. Runa Team has recent momentum with a 2-0 win over Nigma Galaxy, while Xtreme Gaming lost 2-0 to BetBoom, but without head-to-head history, the uncertainty is too high.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Musk's historical average of ~4.4 tweets/day would yield approximately 31 tweets over this 7-day period, far below the 240-259 range which would require 34-37 tweets daily. The market already prices this at only 1.5% probability, correctly reflecting the extremely low likelihood of this specific range.",

Without current game state or draft information for today's actual Game 2, historical data alone is insufficient for a confident prediction.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This is the first-ever meeting between these teams with no head-to-head history. While Runa Team has recent momentum (2-0 vs Nigma) and Xtreme Gaming lost 0-2 to BetBoom, one match of recent form is too limited for a confident Game 2 prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Musk averaged 4.4 tweets/day in November 2025 (132 total), which extrapolates to ~31 tweets over 7 days. The 240-259 range requires 34-37 tweets/day\u2014an 8x increase from his recent baseline with no evidence of such dramatic change in posting behavior.",
