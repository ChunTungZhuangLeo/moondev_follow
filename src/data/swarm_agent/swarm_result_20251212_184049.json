      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 33.0%\nEdge: -8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -8% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: The recent performance of the St. Louis Blues has been inconsistent, with a significant loss to the Bruins indicating defensive vulnerabilities. Given this and the fact that they have to cover a -1.5 spread, the true probability of winning by two or more goals is likely lower than the market implies.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +2.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +2.2% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: Heroic is heavily favored due to their higher ranking and community support, but the edge is not sufficient to recommend a trade given the 10% threshold. The probability aligns closely with the market's, suggesting no significant mispricing.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -12.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: -12.8% \u00d7 potential payout\nReasoning: Despite being slightly higher in the standings, Eintracht Braunschweig's probability of winning does not justify the high market price.

The Blues just lost 5-2 to Boston showing defensive vulnerabilities, and while they beat Ottawa 2-1 recently, winning by 2+ goals against even a weaker Blackhawks team is uncertain. The market price seems fairly accurate.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (72% - 77.8%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: While Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 for Pipsqueak+4, both teams have identical 2-5 recent form. Game 1 of a Bo3 introduces variance - the underdog often takes a game. The 97% community prediction seems overconfident; single game outcomes in Dota have significant upset potential. However, edge isn't quite at the 10% threshold.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8% (35% - 92.8%)\nExpected Value: Extremely high (betting NO at 7.2% for ~35% true probability)\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. Braunschweig (14th, 14 pts) is playing AWAY at Dynamo Dresden (17th, 13 pts). Both teams are struggling with similar records. Away wins in 2. Bundesliga occur roughly 25-35% of the time. A 92.8% win probability for an away team in a match between two relegation-threatened sides is absurd. Their last meeting was a 1-1 draw.\n\n**Decision: NO** (Strong conviction - massive mispricing)",

They beat Ottawa 2-1 but needed 41 saves from their goalie. Covering -1.5 requires winning by 2+ goals, which is difficult given their inconsistent form. Market price is roughly accurate.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE - Edge is only 2%, well below the 10% threshold for action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1**\n\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +2.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low (~$0.10 per $1 bet)\n\nReasoning: Heroic is ranked #9 vs #25 Pipsqueak+4, and the community prediction is 97% for Heroic overall. However, this is specifically Game 1 of a BO3, where variance is higher. Both teams have identical 2-5 recent form, suggesting some volatility. Market has priced this reasonably.\n\nDecision: NO_TRADE - Edge is only 2.2%, insufficient for recommended action.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -67.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Excellent on NO side (~$2.90 per $1 bet)\n\nReasoning: This is AWAY at Dynamo Dresden, not a home match. Both teams are struggling near relegation (17th vs 14th), separated by just 1 point. Recent H2H was a 1-1 draw. A 92.8% probability for an away win between two bottom-table teams is drastically overpriced - this should be closer to 25-30% at best.\n\nDecision: **NO** - Massive -67.8% edge indicates the market has severely overvalued Braunschweig's chances.
