  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts Cornyn will not win the primary, while Paxton is favored to win it, based on consistent polling showing his lead and Cornyn's decline. There is unanimous agreement that the Giants, despite being favored, are unlikely to cover the -2.5 spread due to their losing streak and key injuries. The only minor disagreement is one model's \"NO_TRADE\" on the NFL game, while all others confidently pick against the Giants.",

Cornyn's unfavorable ratings are also high, suggesting significant challenges in his campaign. Given the trade activity and polling trends, betting on Cornyn not winning seems reasonable.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Ken Paxton is currently leading in multiple polls against his primary competitors, including John Cornyn, and has officially entered the race with a strong conservative positioning. The close race dynamics and recent favorable polling indicate a good chance that Paxton might win the primary.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The Giants are on a seven-game losing streak and have significant injuries, including key defensive players like Kayvon Thibodeaux. Despite being favored by 2.5 points, the circumstances suggest betting against them covering the spread is prudent, especially given the heavy trade volume on the Commanders.",
