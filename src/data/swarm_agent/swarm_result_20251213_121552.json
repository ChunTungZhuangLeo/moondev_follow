  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong agreement on Market 2, recommending a \"YES\" trade on the Capitals due to a significant positive edge from their superior form. For Markets 1 and 3, the analyses generally agree on avoiding trades, though AI #3's extreme outlier probability for Market 1 highlights a major disagreement in conviction. Overall, only the Capitals vs. Jets market meets the 10%+ edge threshold for a recommended trade based on the synthesized probabilities.",
