  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1 is accurately priced with no actionable edge, while Markets 2 and 3 reveal a clear split: most AIs find value betting against the Cavaliers spread and the CS:GO favorite 9INE, but a minority see a strong contrarian opportunity on the Cavaliers. This disagreement highlights the subjective nature of interpreting sports data against point spreads and team form. Overall, only the dissenting Cavaliers 'YES' call meets the requested 10%+ edge threshold from the original question.",

Given the small difference between my estimation and the market's price, there isn't enough edge to justify a trade.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO**  \nYour Probability: 40%  \nMarket Price: 52.0%  \nEdge: -12% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -12% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite being favored with a moneyline of -800, the Cavaliers have been struggling, losing five of their last seven games.

The announcement itself likely satisfies the \"create\" condition for 2025. Market is correctly priced near certainty - no meaningful edge exists either direction.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Spread: Cavaliers (-14.5)**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 40%\nMarket Price: 52%\nEdge: -12%\nExpected Value: 12% \u00d7 ~2.0 = ~24% ROI\nReasoning: Despite Cavaliers being heavy favorites on moneyline, covering 14.5 points is extremely difficult. Cleveland has lost 5 of their last 7 games, showing poor form. Even with Allen returning, a 15+ point margin against any NBA team is uncertain. The Wizards are bad but 14.5 is a massive spread for a struggling team to cover, even against the worst teams.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Counter-Strike: 9INE vs SPARTA (BO3)**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 50%\nMarket Price: 67.9%\nEdge: -17.9%\nExpected Value: 17.9% \u00d7 ~3.1 = ~55% ROI\nReasoning: 9INE has only a 20% win rate over the past month despite being slightly higher ranked. SPARTA has 58% win rate recently, showing much better form. Rankings are nearly identical (61 vs 63), but recent form strongly favors SPARTA. Market appears to be overvaluing 9INE's historical ranking while ignoring their recent collapse in form.",
