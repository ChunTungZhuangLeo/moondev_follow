([foxsports.com](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/nba/76ers-vs-pacers-prediction-odds-picks-dec-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **76ers:** In their most recent game on December 7, 2025, the 76ers narrowly lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, 112-108. Tyrese Maxey led the team with 28 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds. Joel Embiid struggled offensively, shooting 4-of-21 from the field.

([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/trump-gold-card-applications-citizenship-immigration?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite the program's official launch, prediction markets indicate skepticism about its success. On Polymarket, there is a 67% chance that no Gold Cards will be sold in 2025, with a 22% chance of selling between 1 and 100 cards.

The Pacers have shown improvement, making a comfortable 76ers win less certain.

The Pacers have won two straight and are showing improvement. A 6.5-point spread is substantial given the 76ers' inconsistency. However, home court advantage and talent edge slightly favor Philly covering, but not by enough to deviate significantly from market price.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -32%\n\nReasoning: The program just launched on December 10, 2025, with applications now open. There are only ~20 days left in 2025. While processing takes time, wealthy individuals seeking U.S. residency have strong incentive to apply quickly. The $1M price point is accessible to many wealthy foreign nationals. The market seems to overestimate the probability of ZERO sales - even one completed sale resolves this NO. Given the program is live and accepting applications, at least one sale completing before year-end is plausible.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -36%\n\nReasoning: Despite U.S. pressure and military posturing, Maduro has survived numerous crises since 2019. He retains military loyalty, Russian/Chinese backing (Putin just reaffirmed support), and controls state institutions. Authoritarian leaders rarely fall within such short timeframes without internal military defection. The market appears to be overweighting Trump's rhetoric and underweighting Maduro's proven resilience and international support network.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- Market 1: NO_TRADE (insufficient edge)\n- Market 2: NO (32% edge - market overvalues zero sales)\n- Market 3: NO (36% edge - market overvalues regime change)",

Pacers showing momentum with 2-game win streak. The 6.5-point spread is appropriately priced given both teams' current form and Embiid's inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -62.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive EV on NO side\nReasoning: The Gold Card program officially LAUNCHED on December 10, 2025 with applications now open. With a $1M price point targeting wealthy foreigners and 19+ days remaining in December alone, the 87% probability of ZERO sales is absurdly high. Even 1-5 sales would make NO winners. Market severely mispriced.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: -6.0% (Your prob - Market)\nReasoning: While Trump is applying military pressure and Putin backing Maduro shows regime stability concerns, authoritarian leaders rarely fall on predictable timelines. The 3.5-month window is short, but U.S. military build-up and economic pressure create real risk. Edge insufficient for trade despite recent NO volume.\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 2 (NO) - Gold Cards**\nThis is the strongest opportunity. An official government program that launched 2 days ago with 19+ days left in 2025 has an 87% probability of zero sales? This defies logic. Even minimal uptake (1-10 cards) at $1M each would resolve NO as the winner. The market appears to be pricing in complete program failure despite active applications being accepted.",
