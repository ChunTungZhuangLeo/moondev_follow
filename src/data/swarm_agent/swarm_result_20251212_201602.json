Their most recent encounter occurred on August 23, 2025, during the FISSURE Universe: Episode 6 Playoffs Lower Bracket Semifinal, where Team Falcons secured a 2-1 victory over PARIVISION. ([strafe.com](https://www.strafe.com/match/team-falcons-vs-parivision-lower-bracket-semifinal-fissure-universe-episode-6-735506/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn that series, PARIVISION won the first game with a score of 9-9, while Team Falcons won the second game 19-20. The third and decisive game concluded with Team Falcons winning 25-24. Notably, ButterflyEffect from Team Falcons achieved the highest number of kills in the match with 19, and Dukalis from PARIVISION recorded the most assists with 40.

In fact, Carlson has publicly endorsed Vice President J.D. Vance as the most capable successor to President Donald Trump. In a March 2025 interview, Carlson stated that Vance is the only person in the Republican Party capable of carrying on and expanding Trump's legacy. ([the-independent.com](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/tucker-carlson-donald-trump-2028-b2718699.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, political prediction markets reflect this sentiment. For instance, the Media Predict platform currently assigns a 22.4% probability to the possibility of Carlson running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028.

This AFC North matchup is crucial for both teams' playoff aspirations.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Baltimore Ravens:**\n  - *Injuries:* Quarterback Lamar Jackson returned to practice on December 11 after missing a session for rest. Despite missing multiple practices in recent weeks, Jackson is expected to start against the Bengals. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/ravens-qb-lamar-jackson-returns-practice--flm-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n  - *Suspension:* Offensive lineman Ben Cleveland has been suspended for three games due to a violation of the NFL's substances of abuse policy. He will miss the games against the Bengals, New England Patriots, and Green Bay Packers.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 2 as a clear trading opportunity, with all AIs agreeing the 96.8% price for \"YES\" is a severe error given Carlson's non-candidacy, strongly recommending a \"NO\" bet. For Market 1, most analysts see no significant edge, deeming the price fair based on outdated historical data. Regarding Market 3, opinions are split on the Ravens' chances, showing no unified trading signal.",

However, the web search provides no current context for this specific match, and 61.5% seems reasonable for a favored team in a single game. Without live match context or current form data, I cannot justify significant edge either direction.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Tucker Carlson win the 2028 Republican presidential nomination?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 3%\nMarket Price: 96.8%\nEdge: -93.8%\nExpected Value: Extremely high (betting NO at 3.2% for ~97% true probability of NO)\nReasoning: This market price appears to be an ERROR or manipulation. Tucker Carlson has NOT announced a presidential run, has publicly endorsed JD Vance as Trump's successor, and other prediction markets show only ~22% chance he even RUNS. A 96.8% probability of winning the nomination is absurdly mispriced - this should be closer to 3-5% at most.

Lamar Jackson is expected to play despite rest days. The Bengals are at home and desperate for playoff positioning, but their record suggests they're the underdog. Market price of 42% for Bengals seems approximately fair given home field advantage partially offsetting talent differential. Not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Market 1: NO_TRADE\n- Market 2: **STRONG NO** (massive mispricing detected)\n- Market 3: NO_TRADE",

However, the 3.5% edge is insufficient given esports volatility and the 4-month gap since their last match. No recent form data available.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Will Tucker Carlson win the 2028 Republican presidential nomination?**\n\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 96.8%\nEdge: -88.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: STRONG NO POSITION (+88.8% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: **CRITICAL ERROR IN MARKET PRICING** - The 96.8% price means market thinks Carlson WON'T win (this is NO probability). Carlson has endorsed JD Vance, shows no campaign infrastructure, and has only 22.4% probability of even RUNNING per other prediction markets.

Playing in Cincinnati is a factor, but Ravens' overall roster strength and Jackson's MVP-caliber play justify a 56% win probability versus the market's 42% pricing. The Ben Cleveland suspension is minimal impact (backup OL).\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET YES ON RAVENS at 42% (14% edge)**\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF ACTIONABLE TRADES:\n\n**STRONG BET: Market 3 - Ravens to Win**\n- Edge: +14.0%\n- Expected Value: +33.3%\n- Rationale: Market undervaluing Ravens' strength with healthy Lamar Jackson\n\n**Markets 1 & 2: NO_TRADE**\n- Market 1: Insufficient edge (3.5%)\n- Market 2: Market already correctly priced",
