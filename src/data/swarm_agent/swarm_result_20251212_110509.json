On Market 2, most analyses see the price as fair or slightly inflated, resulting in a \"NO_TRADE\" consensus due to insufficient edge.",

Home advantage and form favor Angers, but 58% vs 55% market price provides insufficient edge for a trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -24.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High (~0.25 \u00d7 payout on NO side)\nReasoning: Market was 68% probability in November, now dropped to 50%. Pre-launch hype typically exceeds reality for crypto launches. Most DEX tokens launch below inflated FDV expectations, and $3B is extremely ambitious for a new DEX in current market conditions.

Rubio has explicitly endorsed Vance and isn't running. The 95.9% price is completely divorced from reality.
