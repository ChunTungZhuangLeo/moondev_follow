However, the 81% market price already reflects this dominance. While Thunder should win, the 4% edge doesn't meet the 10% threshold for a confident bet.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Will Trump create a tariff dividend in 2025?\n**Your Probability:** 5%\n**Market Price:** 97.5% (NO is priced at 2.5%)\n**Edge:** -92.5% (Market severely overvalues YES)\n**Expected Value:** EXCELLENT on NO side\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** The question asks about creation in 2025, but all sources indicate payments would begin \"mid-2026\" - not 2025. The proposal exists but implementation timeline is clearly 2026. Market is massively mispricing this timing distinction. This is a strong NO bet with 92.5% edge.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Cavaliers (-14.5) vs Wizards\n**Your Probability:** 45%\n**Market Price:** 52%\n**Edge:** -7% (Market slightly overvalues Cavaliers covering)\n**Expected Value:** Moderate but below threshold\n**Decision:** NO_TRADE\n\n**Reasoning:** Cavaliers lost 5 of last 7 games and are struggling, though facing the weak Wizards. 14.5-point spread is substantial. While Jarrett Allen may return and they're favored, their recent form makes covering 14.5 questionable. 7% edge toward NO isn't sufficient for recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE:** Market 2 - Bet NO on tariff dividend in 2025\n**EDGE:** 92.5% (exceptional value)\n**CONFIDENCE:** Very High - clear timeline mismatch between question and reality",
