However, Perth Glory has won 3 straight at home and Sydney is traveling to HBF Park. Home advantage in A-League is significant. While Sydney is the better team, the edge is just under 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: Cavaliers vs. Wizards O/U 245.5\n\n**Your Probability:** 35%\n**Market Price:** 50.0%\n**Edge:** -15.0% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive on UNDER (+$0.15 per $1 risked)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** Cleveland scored a season-low 94 points recently and has lost 5 of 7 games, indicating offensive struggles. Washington is tied for fewest wins in the league and struggling badly. The Cavaliers' recent low-scoring performances and defensive focus during their 5-day break suggest a lower-scoring game. 245.5 is extremely high for a team that just scored 94.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: Texas Longhorns vs. Connecticut Huskies\n\n**Your Probability:** 12%\n**Market Price:** 90.0%\n**Edge:** -78.0% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Massive positive on TEXAS (+$0.78 per $1 risked)\n**Decision:** NO\n\n**Reasoning:** UConn is #5 ranked, on a 5-game win streak, playing at home in Hartford, and just beat #18 Florida. Texas beat Southern University (a much weaker opponent) 95-69. The market correctly prices UConn as heavy favorites - this is approximately 90% accurate. UConn should win this game convincingly at home.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- **Market 1 (Sydney FC):** NO_TRADE - Edge insufficient (9.3%)\n- **Market 2 (Cavs/Wizards UNDER):** NO - Strong 15% edge on Under\n- **Market 3 (Texas):** NO - Correctly priced, bet UConn\n\n**BEST BET:** Market 2 - Bet UNDER 245.5 points (equivalent to betting NO on the Over)",
