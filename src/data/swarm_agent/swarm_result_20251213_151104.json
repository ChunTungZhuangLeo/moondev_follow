  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows significant disagreement on Market 1's true probability, with estimates ranging from 50% to 78%, creating no clear trade signal. For Markets 2 and 3, there is general agreement that the current prices are reasonable, leading to a consensus of \"NO_TRADE\" for both. Overall, the lack of consistent 10%+ edge estimates across the analyses suggests no strongly recommended trades based on the provided information.",
