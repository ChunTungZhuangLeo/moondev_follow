For instance, the first-edition Omanyte card saw a 600% price increase, though it remains less valuable than the Kabuto card.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite the recent surge in the Kabuto card's price due to Kabuto King's market activities, the current price is reported to be over $37, with no indication that it will reach $100 by the end of December. The significant gap to $100 makes it unlikely to achieve this price in the short time frame remaining.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Nottingham Forest has shown mixed form, with a notable victory against Liverpool but a subsequent loss to Brighton. Tottenham's recent win indicates they are competitive. The outcome is uncertain, and without more decisive evidence favoring Nottingham Forest, a bet on this market is too risky.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: SC Freiburg has been strong at home, winning four consecutive matches at the Europa-Park Stadion, and they face a Salzburg team that has struggled in the Europa League. Given Freiburg's home advantage and Salzburg's poor form, Freiburg is well-positioned to win this match.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite Kabuto King's aggressive buying driving prices from under $1 to over $37, reaching $100 by December 31 would require nearly tripling the current price in a very short timeframe. The market cornering strategy has limits, and the large trade on No suggests smart money doubts the $100 target will be hit.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Nottingham Forest's impressive 3-0 victory at Anfield shows they can compete with top sides, and playing at home at the City Ground gives them an advantage against a Tottenham side that has been inconsistent. Forest's home form and recent momentum make them a reasonable pick.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: SC Freiburg has won four consecutive home matches and faces a struggling Red Bull Salzburg team that has only managed 3 points from 5 Europa League matches. The home advantage at Europa-Park Stadion combined with Salzburg's poor European form makes Freiburg the clear favorite.",
