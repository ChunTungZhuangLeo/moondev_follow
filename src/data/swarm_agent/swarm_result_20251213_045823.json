For Market 2, there is notable agreement that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's inconsistency makes the \"NO\" bet on the spread more favorable than the market price suggests. Regarding Market 3, while most AIs believe \"YES\" on the over is correct, the calculated edges are generally below the 10% threshold required for a recommended trade.",

However, Brest won the previous H2H 2-1 and has decent away form. This is essentially a coin flip with minimal edge either direction.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 40%\nMarket Price: 53.5%\nEdge: -13.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong negative edge suggests NO bet\nReasoning: Atl\u00e9tico's recent form is concerning with two consecutive away defeats and inconsistent performances. A -1.5 spread requires them to win by 2+ goals, which seems overpriced given their struggles. The market hasn't fully adjusted for their recent defensive lapses and away form issues.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 86%\nEdge: +6% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive edge, but below 10% threshold\nReasoning: Arsenal leads the Premier League with elite home form (3 consecutive wins, averaging 3 goals scored, <1 conceded). Wolves are dead last with 0 wins in 15 matches, scoring only 8 goals total. Over 1.5 goals is highly likely given Arsenal's attacking prowess and Wolves' defensive frailty (33 conceded). However, edge is just below the 10% requirement.\n\n**REVISED DECISION: NO_TRADE** - While the probability assessment favors Over 1.5, the 6% edge doesn't meet the 10% minimum threshold for a recommended trade.",
