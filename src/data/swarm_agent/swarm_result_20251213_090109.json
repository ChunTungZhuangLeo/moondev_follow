Despite recent bets on the Under, the Canadiens' propensity to score and concede suggests a higher-scoring game, so betting on Over 5.5 goals is likely more favorable.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: FanDuel's announcement of launching \"FanDuel Predicts\" in partnership with CME Group by the end of 2025 and the detailed description of the platform's offerings suggest a strong commitment to this timeline. As such, the likelihood of this launch occurring as planned appears high.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Arminia Bielefeld is currently in 12th place, while Kaiserslautern is in 6th. Bielefeld's recent form is slightly better, but Kaiserslautern's higher standing and comparable recent performance make a Bielefeld victory less certain.
