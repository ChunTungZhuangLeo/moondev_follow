While Silksong won Best Action/Adventure at The Game Awards, GOTY is a different category with broader competition.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The market asks if Anthropic will NOT IPO by June 30, 2026. Reports indicate Anthropic is actively preparing for an IPO as early as 2026 with legal counsel engaged, though the company says it has \"no immediate plans.\" With the June 2026 deadline still 6+ months away and preparations underway, there's meaningful probability they could IPO before then, making the \"No\" (meaning they WILL IPO) position reasonable.",
