  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no clear trade for Market 1, as most AIs estimate a probability near 50-55% against a 46% market price, falling short of the required 10% edge. For Markets 2 and 3, all models agree the current prices are overvalued, with notable disagreement only on the magnitude of MOUZ's true probability in Market 2. Overall, no market meets the 10% edge threshold for a recommended buy, though several indicate the market may be overestimating the favorites.",
