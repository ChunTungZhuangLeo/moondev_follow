The situation remains uncertain, making it difficult to take a strong position.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: There is no credible evidence or announcement suggesting Zelenskyy will resign by the end of 2026. He remains firm in his stance on territorial integrity amid ongoing peace negotiations. The lack of significant political pressure or alternative indications makes a resignation unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite Russian efforts to encircle Huliaipole, Ukrainian forces have successfully repelled assaults and strengthened defenses with reserves. The ongoing resistance and logistical challenges faced by Russian forces suggest that capturing Huliaipole by December 31 is unlikely.",

The Financial Times often follows similar themes, and Huang's AI leadership makes him a frontrunner, though no FT announcement yet.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite peace negotiation pressures and fluctuating approval ratings, Zelenskyy has shown no indication of resigning and continues actively leading diplomatic efforts. Wartime leadership transitions are rare, and he maintains constitutional legitimacy despite the postponed elections.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: With only 19 days remaining until December 31, Russian forces are still attempting encirclement tactics rather than controlling the town, and Ukrainian forces have repelled multiple assaults while deploying reserves. The timeline is too short for a likely capture given current defensive positions.",
