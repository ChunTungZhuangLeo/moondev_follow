  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a significant mispricing in Market 2, with most analysts agreeing Cornyn's true probability is far below the 75% market price, making \"NO\" a strong recommended trade. For Market 1, opinions on Paxton's chances vary, leading to a general \"NO_TRADE\" recommendation due to insufficient edge. Market 3 is consistently seen as having minimal edge, resulting in a neutral consensus with no clear trade.",

While Paxton has Trump's backing, the race is competitive with three strong candidates. The market at 42.4% seems roughly fair given polling uncertainty and the long timeframe until the primary.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will John Cornyn win the 2026 Texas Republican Primary?**\n\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 75.0%\nEdge: -47%\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side (~0.47 \u00d7 4.0 = 1.88 per dollar risked)\nReasoning: This market appears severely mispriced. The news explicitly states Cornyn is polling at just 25% (third place behind Paxton at 36% and Hunt at 26%). The same news mentions Polymarket shows his chances at 28%, yet this market shows 75%. This is either a stale market price or a massive inefficiency. Cornyn is trailing significantly and facing strong headwinds from the Trump-aligned base.\n\n**Decision: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Spread: Giants (-2.5)**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 48.0%\nEdge: -13%\nExpected Value: ~0.13 \u00d7 1.92 = 0.25 per dollar risked\nReasoning: The market title says \"Giants (-2.5)\" but the news context discusses Giants vs 49ers where 49ers are favored by 2.5 points. The Giants have significant injuries (Thibodeaux out, Jones out for season) and are substantial underdogs. Giants covering as 2.5-point favorites against the Commanders seems unlikely given their poor season. The 48% price overvalues the Giants.\n\n**Decision: NO**",

In a crowded primary, Paxton's plurality doesn't guarantee victory if it goes to runoff. Market price seems roughly fair given uncertainty.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 22%\nMarket Price: 75.0%\nEdge: -53.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +53% on NO position\nReasoning: Cornyn is polling THIRD at 25%, behind both Paxton (36%) and Hunt (26%). The 75% market price is drastically overvalued - likely stale pricing that hasn't incorporated November polling showing his collapse. This is a clear NO bet with massive edge.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 48.0%\nEdge: -3.0% (Your prob - Market)\nReasoning: The context appears confused (mentions 49ers game, not Commanders), but Giants are 2-11 and missing key defensive players like Thibodeaux. The -2.5 spread at 48% seems fairly priced for a struggling team. Insufficient edge to justify trade.\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: Market 2 - BET NO on Cornyn**\nThis is the strongest opportunity with 53% edge. The market hasn't priced in his third-place polling position. Even if he makes a runoff, he'd need to overcome both Paxton AND Hunt's stronger positions with the Trump-aligned base.",
