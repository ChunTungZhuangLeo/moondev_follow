  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong \"YES\" edge for Market 1, with most models estimating a 65-80% true probability versus the 60% market price. There is unanimous agreement that Market 2's \"NO\" outcome is severely undervalued, as the 97% market price contradicts the lack of any supporting launch information. For Market 3, most analysts agree the \"NO\" trade holds value, though they disagree on the true probability, all concluding the 81% market price for St. Pauli covering the spread is too high.",
