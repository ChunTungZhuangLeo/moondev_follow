The most recent airdrop, known as the \"Season 2 Airdrop,\" is set to conclude on December 31, 2025.

([freecoins24.io](https://freecoins24.io/airdrops/hyperliquid-season-2-airdrop/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn June 2025, a prediction market on Polymarket indicated a 4% chance of a second airdrop by December 31, 2025. However, this market has since been resolved, and no new airdrop has been announced. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/hyperliquid-airdop-by?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven the lack of official announcements and the conclusion of the Season 2 Airdrop, it appears unlikely that Hyperliquid will conduct another airdrop by December 31, 2025.\n\nFor more insights on potential future air\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Charlie Kirk be on the Time 2025 person of the year shortlist?\nCurrent Market Price: 97.8% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,545.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/who-makes-times-2025-person-of-the-year-shortlist\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 12, 2025, Time magazine has not included Charlie Kirk on its Person of the Year shortlist. The 2025 honoree is the \"Architects of AI,\" recognizing leaders like Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, for their significant contributions to artificial intelligence. ([time.com](https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/?utm_source=openai))\n\nCharlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, was assassinated on September 10, 2025, while speaking at Utah Valley University. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/cac78923ecee4b3ddd116c13966c173b?utm_source=openai)) In the wake of his death, there have been efforts to honor his legacy. On December 10, 2025, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced a bill to rename Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., to \"Charlie Kirk Freedom of Speech Plaza.\" However, the bill's prospects are uncertain, especially in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

The group has consistently rejected full disarmament, proposing instead a temporary weapons \"freeze\" or storage to ensure a long-term truce with Israel. Khaled Meshaal, a senior Hamas leader, stated that total disarmament is \"unacceptable,\" emphasizing that weapons could be stored to prevent military escalation from Gaza. ([hurriyetdailynews.com](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/hamas-proposes-weapons-freeze-in-return-for-long-term-truce-216685?utm_source=openai))\n\nIsraeli officials have insisted on Hamas's disarmament as a core requirement of the ceasefire's second phase. Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for the Israeli prime minister's office, affirmed that Israel will continue to follow the 20-point plan, which includes disarming Hamas.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly agrees that Markets 2 and 3 are severely mispriced, recommending \"NO\" bets due to near-certain outcomes based on definitive news. For Market 1, most analysts see a low probability but deem the edge insufficient for a trade, indicating general agreement with the market's low price.
