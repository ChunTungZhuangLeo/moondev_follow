  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear betting opportunity on Market 2 (Lighter FDV), with strong agreement that the 97.1% \"Yes\" price is severely overvalued, making \"No\" a high-edge trade.

But news says only 2.1% probability on Polymarket itself. This appears to be a data discrepancy.

Girona is struggling worse (18th, 4-match winless streak). This is essentially a coin flip between two underperforming teams. Market price of 56% seems roughly fair given home advantage.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 1%\nMarket Price: 97.1%\nEdge: -96.1% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Lighter raised $68M at $1.5B valuation in November 2025. Expecting a 7x jump to $10B+ FDV in one day is extremely unrealistic. Even optimistic pre-launch predictions only showed 27% chance of $6B. The 97.1% YES price is massively overvalued - this should be betting NO at 2.9% to win.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO - The market is pricing this backwards. There's only ~1-3% chance of >$10B FDV, not 97%.**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES (Thunder to win)\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: +4% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Slightly positive but below threshold\nReasoning: Thunder are on a historic 16-game win streak with 24-1 record, just destroyed Suns 138-89. Spurs are missing Victor Wembanyama (their star player) due to calf injury. Thunder should be even stronger favorites than 81%, but edge is insufficient for trade recommendation.\n\n**Note: Edge is only 4%, below the 10% threshold for recommended trades.**",
