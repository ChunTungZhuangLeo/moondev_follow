However, prediction markets have been active in estimating his tweeting behavior during this period. On Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been placing bets on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market has seen significant trading volume, indicating active participation and interest in this prediction. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhile these markets provide insights into public expectations, they do not offer concrete data on Musk's actual tweeting activity during the specified period.

This market involves wagering on whether the total number of goals scored in a match will be over or under 2.5. A bet on \"Over 2.5\" wins if the match ends with 3 or more goals, while \"Under 2.5\" wins if there are 2 or fewer goals scored.

Even if Musk averages ~40 tweets/day (280/week), the variance in his posting behavior makes hitting this exact narrow window unlikely. The 85.2% price seems artificially inflated - perhaps this specific bucket was leading when trading occurred, but the probability of landing in ANY specific 20-tweet range should be much lower. Historical tweet counts vary significantly week to week.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 32%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +3% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after a strong 2-0 win over Falcons and has been the most-watched team. Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (~18%) have improved given their advancement. With 4 teams remaining, a baseline probability is 25%. Given their strong form and momentum, I'd estimate slightly above baseline at ~32%, but this doesn't meet the 10% edge threshold.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match TS vs VIT)**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match (best-of-3 format based on context). Over 2.5 means the match goes to 3 maps. CS2 matches between evenly-matched top teams typically go to 3 maps ~50-60% of the time. Without specific head-to-head data, the 50% price seems reasonable. My slight lean toward Over isn't strong enough to meet the 10% threshold.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",

The 280-299 range is highly specific, and without real-time tracking data, the market price likely reflects informed participants monitoring his actual activity.

Pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15-18% implied) have dramatically improved. Market severely underpricing their championship chances at 29% when they're one of two remaining teams with strong form.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 48%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: -2.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (Team Spirit vs Vitality based on URL). Without specific team matchup analysis, recent head-to-head data, or map pool information, the 50/50 market price seems efficiently priced as a coin flip. The $990 recent bet on Over doesn't provide enough signal to establish meaningful edge.\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY:\n**TRADE: Market 2 - YES on Team Spirit**\n- Strong 16% edge with Team Spirit already in finals\n- Recent dominant performance not fully priced in\n- Significant expected value at current 29% odds",
