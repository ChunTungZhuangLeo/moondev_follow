  "prompt": "Analyze these 3 Polymarket markets.\n\nFor EACH market:\n1. Estimate the TRUE PROBABILITY based on news context\n2. Calculate EDGE vs market price\n3. Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 140-159 tweets from December 12 to December 19, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 95.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,520.03 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, prediction markets indicate a low probability that Elon Musk will post between 140 and 159 tweets from December 12 to December 19, 2025. On Polymarket, the \"Yes\" outcome for this range is priced at 1.4%, with \"No\" at 98.6%. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-12-december-19-140-159?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis suggests that market participants anticipate Musk's tweet count during this period to be outside the 140-159 range. However, without specific data on Musk's recent tweeting habits, it's challenging to predict his exact activity.\n\nIn related news, a U.S. startup named Operation Bluebird has petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the \"Twitter\" and \"tweet\" trademarks, arguing that Elon Musk\u2019s X Corp has abandoned them following Twitter's 2023 rebranding to X. The Virginia-based company, led by former Twitter trademark lawyer Stephen Coates, seeks to reclaim these trademarks for \n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Putin out as President of Russia by end of 2026?\nCurrent Market Price: 88.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $880.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/putin-out-before-2027\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no official announcement or credible evidence indicating that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to resign by the end of 2026. In fact, recent developments suggest that Putin remains firmly in power.\n\nIn March 2024, Putin secured a fifth presidential term with over 87% of the vote, extending his rule to three decades. This victory was made possible through constitutional amendments allowing him to run again in 2030. The election, however, lacked independent oversight and occurred in a climate of propaganda and repression, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ([lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2024/03/18/putin-s-forced-triumph_6630623_23.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nDomestically, Putin's approval ratings have remained high. In June 2025, 86% of Russians approved of his activities, a nine-percentage-point increase from September 2022. This surge coincided with the annexation of Crimea and escalating tensions with the \n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Up Only podcast released by December 31?\nCurrent Market Price: 84.9% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/up-only-podcast-released-by-october-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nThe UpOnly podcast has been actively engaging its audience through a prediction market on Polymarket, focusing on potential guest appearances by December 31, 2025. As of October 21, 2025, the market had a total volume of $182,263, with notable participants such as Thomas Lee (40% chance), Brian Armstrong (30%), and Gainzy (27%). ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/which-guests-will-appear-on-the-uponly-podcast-by-december-31?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the broader podcasting landscape, the Golden Globe Awards announced the introduction of a Best Podcast category for the 2026 ceremony, aiming to recognize excellence in podcasting. This new category has sparked discussions within the industry.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a critical data discrepancy in Market 1, with most analysts noting the 95% price likely refers to the \"No\" side, making a trade unclear. For Market 2, there is sharp disagreement on the true probability, leading to conflicting \"Yes\" and \"No\" trade recommendations without a clear majority. Regarding Market 3, the edge is generally seen as insufficient across responses, resulting in a consensus for no trade.",

The market correctly prices this as very unlikely (~95% NO = ~5% YES), and my estimate of ~2% YES probability doesn't provide sufficient edge to overcome fees and risk.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 98%\nMarket Price: 88.0% (NO side = Putin stays)\nEdge: +10% (minimum threshold met)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive - edge exactly at threshold\nReasoning: Putin just won reelection in 2024 with 87% and constitutional amendments allow him to run until 2030. He has 86% approval ratings and complete control of Russian institutions. The probability he leaves power by end of 2026 is extremely low (~2%), meaning NO should be priced at 98%+. Current 88% NO is undervalued by 10%.\n\n**RECOMMENDED TRADE: BET NO (Putin stays in power)**\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 88%\nMarket Price: 84.9% (YES side)\nEdge: +3.1% (insufficient)\nExpected Value: Low - below threshold\nReasoning: The UpOnly podcast appears to be actively running with recent guest prediction markets and regular engagement. An 85% probability of release by December 31 seems reasonable given we're already mid-December. My slightly higher estimate of 88% doesn't provide the required 10%+ edge for a trade recommendation.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- 1 trade recommended (Market 2: BET NO on Putin leaving)\n- 2 markets lack sufficient edge for trading\n- Market 2 offers exactly 10% edge at minimum threshold",

The 95.0% price provided in the prompt is clearly an error or mislabel (it likely represents the \"NO\" side).

However, the market price at 88% for \"NO\" (i.e., 12% for \"YES\") already reflects this low probability, leaving no significant edge.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 60%\nMarket Price: 84.9%\nEdge: -24.9% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +24.9% (Betting NO at 15.1% price implies an 84.9% win probability vs. our 40% true probability for YES)\nReasoning: The context discusses guest speculation and industry awards but provides no concrete evidence the podcast itself will be released by the deadline. The high market price seems overly optimistic without a confirmed release date or announcement, suggesting a lower true probability.",

There appears to be a data error in the question - the 95% likely refers to NO, not YES. Musk typically posts far more than 140-159 tweets per week (often 200-400+), making this narrow range unlikely. The true probability of hitting exactly this range is very low.\n\n**Wait - reanalyzing:** If market price for YES is truly 95%, this is massively mispriced. However, given the search shows YES at 1.4%, I suspect the 95% figure is actually the NO price. Without clarity, I'll pass.\n\nMARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: ~5% for YES\nMarket Price: Unclear (conflicting data)\nEdge: Cannot calculate reliably\nReasoning: Conflicting information between provided market price (95% YES) and web search (1.4% YES).

An 88% YES price is absurdly mispriced - this should be under 10%.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Up Only podcast released by December 31?**\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 92%\nMarket Price: 84.9%\nEdge: +7.1%\nExpected Value: Marginal\nReasoning: The search shows UpOnly is actively running prediction markets about guests through December 31, 2025, indicating the podcast is operational.
