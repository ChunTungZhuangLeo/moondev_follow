([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?utm_source=openai)) This marks the highest number of cases in over three decades. ([aha.org](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-07-07-us-hits-highest-measles-case-count-over-30-years?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe outbreaks are widespread, with 47 reported across 43 states.

This type of bet is prevalent in sports like soccer and hockey, where scoring can vary significantly. ([rantsports.com](https://www.rantsports.com/betting/dictionary/over-45-goals-meaning/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Examples:**\n\n- **NHL Games on December 11, 2025:**\n  - *St. Louis Blues vs. Nashville Predators*: The final score was 2-7, totaling 9 goals, which would have exceeded an Over 4.5 bet.\n  - *Boston Bruins vs. Winnipeg Jets*: The game ended 6-3, totaling 9 goals, also surpassing the Over 4.5 threshold.\n  - *Detroit Red Wings vs. Edmonton Oilers*: The final score was 1-4, totaling 5 goals, exceeding the Over 4.5 line.\n  - *Florida Panthers vs. Colorado Avalanche*: The game concluded with a 2-6 score, totaling 8 goals, above the Over 4.5 mark.\n  - *Buffalo Sabres vs. Vancouver Canucks*: The final score was 3-2, totaling 5 goals, wh\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Vivek Ramaswamy win the 2026 Ohio Governor Republican primary election?\nCurrent Market Price: 87.0% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $870.00 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/ohio-governor-republican-primary-winner\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, Vivek Ramaswamy's prospects in the 2026 Ohio Republican gubernatorial primary appear strong, bolstered by significant political endorsements and favorable polling data.\n\n**Political Endorsements:**\n\n- **Ohio Republican Party Endorsement:** In May 2025, Ramaswamy secured the Ohio Republican Party's endorsement for the 2026 gubernatorial race, a year ahead of the primary. This endorsement was achieved with support from at least two-thirds of the party's governing body, underscoring his substantial backing within the state party.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1's \"YES\" outcome is highly probable, but the edge is consistently calculated below the 10% threshold, leading most models to recommend NO_TRADE. For Market 2, there is significant disagreement on the event type and true probability, resulting in conflicting trade recommendations and a lack of reliable consensus. Regarding Market 3, analyses are split, with some seeing value in \"NO\" and others deeming the edge too small, indicating high uncertainty.",
