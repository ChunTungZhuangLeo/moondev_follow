  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 3's \"NO\" outcome is severely undervalued, with all analysts assigning a very low true probability against the market's high price, presenting a massive calculated edge. For Market 1, most agree the true probability is high (80-92%), but there is disagreement on whether the edge meets the 10% threshold for a trade. Regarding Market 2, opinions are split between seeing a valuable edge on MOUZ and avoiding the trade due to market efficiency or variance, though all note MOUZ's recent head-to-head advantage.",

The U.S. just imposed new sanctions on Maduro's family on Dec 11, making a pardon virtually impossible.

A 65+ threshold is quite low for a Cameron blockbuster with strong early buzz, but my edge is only 3%, insufficient for a trade.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Counter-Strike: MOUZ vs FaZe - Map 1 Winner**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 42.2% (for MOUZ)\nEdge: +12.8%\nExpected Value: ~0.30x on MOUZ\nReasoning: Historical data shows MOUZ won Map 1 in 2 of 3 recent matchups against FaZe, including a dominant 13-5 on FaZe's map pick at IEM Chengdu. However, esports markets are highly efficient and the $1,000 recent trade on FaZe suggests informed money. Map pick order and current form are unknown, making this edge uncertain.
