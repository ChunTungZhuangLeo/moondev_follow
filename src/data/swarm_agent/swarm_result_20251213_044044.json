  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 3's 93% price is significantly overvalued, with all AIs recommending a \"NO\" trade due to a large negative edge. For Markets 1 and 2, most AIs advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to insufficient edge, though there is notable disagreement on Team Spirit's true probability, ranging from 25% to 45%. Overall, the only actionable trade with a consistent 10%+ edge opportunity is betting against Paul Mescal winning the Oscar.",

Market at 29% slightly undervalues them, but not enough edge given tournament volatility.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50%\nEdge: +2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge for trade\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match (Team Spirit vs Vitality) over/under 2.5 maps. Without specific head-to-head data or recent form between these teams, the market's 50/50 pricing is reasonable. Slight lean to Over given both teams' playstyles, but edge too small.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 93%\nEdge: -78% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +65% on NO side (78% \u00d7 0.935 payout)\nReasoning: Market has SEVERE mispricing. Paul Mescal is campaigning for SUPPORTING actor for \"Hamnet\" (Shakespeare role), but this is a competitive category with multiple strong contenders. 93% implies near-certainty, which is unjustified 5+ months before ceremony. The recent $1,389 NO trade signals smart money recognizing overvaluation.\n\n**STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION: BET NO ON MARKET 3**\nThis represents exceptional value with the market drastically overpricing Mescal's chances at 93% when realistic probability is closer to 15-20% in a competitive supporting actor field.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: -4% (25% - 29%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in semifinals (top 4), but winning requires beating two more opponents. With typically 4+ strong teams remaining, ~25% is reasonable. The market price is close to fair value given their strong performance but competitive field.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5% (55% - 50%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match (Team Spirit vs Vitality based on the URL). CS2 Major matches at this stage often go to 3 games given competitive parity, but 50/50 pricing already reflects this uncertainty. Without specific head-to-head data, cannot justify 10%+ edge.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 93.0%\nEdge: -18% (75% - 93%)\nExpected Value: 18% \u00d7 ~14.3 (payout on NO at 7%) = ~2.6x potential\nReasoning: While Mescal is a strong contender for *Hamnet*, 93% is overpriced. Supporting Actor categories are notoriously competitive, and the film is just releasing now with limited audience exposure. Other contenders from established films could emerge.
