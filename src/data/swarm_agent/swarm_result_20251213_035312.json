Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet count between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been actively tracking and analyzing his Twitter activity during this period.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been placing bets on the number of tweets Musk will post between December 9 and December 16, 2025. The market with the highest trading volume focuses on the range of 360-379 tweets, with a 12.1% chance of occurrence. Other notable ranges include 400-419 tweets (10.8% chance) and 420-439 tweets (10.5% chance). The 280-299 tweets range has a 5% chance, indicating a lower probability compared to higher tweet counts. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese odds suggest that market participants anticipate a higher tweet count from Musk during this period.

([bo3.gg](https://bo3.gg/news/spirit-knock-falcons-out-of-the-starladder-budapest-major-2025-playoffs?utm_source=openai)) In this match, Ivan \"zweih\" Gogin delivered an exceptional performance, securing an ace on each map, which significantly influenced the outcome.\n\nThroughout Stage 3 of the tournament, Team Spirit demonstrated impressive form, completing a flawless run with three wins from three matches. This strong performance translated into substantial viewership, with their matches averaging over 560,000 viewers, making them the most popular team during this stage.

A bet on \"Over 2.5 Goals\" wins if the match ends with 3 or more goals, while a bet on \"Under 2.5 Goals\" wins if the match ends with 2 or fewer goals.

For instance, the Dutch Eredivisie and the German Bundesliga have high average goals per game, making them favorable for over 2.5 goals predictions. Conversely, leagues like the French Ligue 1 and the Japanese J-League tend to have lower scoring games, making under 2.5 goals predictions more viable.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's 85.2% price as a severe mispricing versus the ~5% true probability, though opinions are split on whether this represents a tradable \"NO\" opportunity or a market anomaly to avoid. For Market 2, all AIs agree Team Spirit's probability is higher than the 29% market price, with most recommending a \"YES\" trade due to a clear >10% edge. Regarding Market 3, analysts uniformly see no edge, as the 50% market price aligns with the lack of specific match context.",

The 85.2% price shown appears to be a data error or refers to a different bucket. Based on Musk's typical high-volume posting behavior, 280-299 is on the lower end of expectations.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +6% (35% - 29%)\nExpected Value: Marginal positive but below threshold\n\nReasoning: Team Spirit has shown dominant form with a flawless Stage 3 run (3-0), beat Team Falcons 2-0, and faces Team Vitality in semifinals. They're performing exceptionally well with star player zweih. However, they still need to win two more matches (semi + final), and esports tournaments are volatile.

Both are top-tier teams. Spirit has been dominant but Vitality is also strong. High-stakes matches between evenly matched elite teams often go to 3 maps. Historical data suggests ~55-60% of such matchups go over 2.5 games, but edge is insufficient.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",

The market at 85.2% is dramatically mispriced, but this appears to be a data/display error.

Both teams are elite offensive squads who made semifinals, and playoff matches between top teams historically trend toward longer series (3+ maps). Spirit's recent 2-0 suggests they can take maps, but Vitality should respond competitively, pushing to 3+ games.\n\n**Decision: YES** (Solid edge on competitive semifinal matchup)",
