Only recommend trades with 10%+ edge\n\n\nMarket 1:\nTitle: Will Elon Musk post 280-299 tweets from December 9 to December 16, 2025?\nCurrent Market Price: 85.2% (this is the market's implied probability)\nRecent trade: $851.55 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 WEB SEARCH CONTEXT:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no specific news or official announcements regarding Elon Musk's tweet count between December 9 and December 16, 2025. However, prediction markets have been actively tracking this metric, reflecting the public's interest in his social media activity.\n\nOn Polymarket, a prediction market platform, participants have been placing bets on the number of tweets Musk will post during this period. The market with the highest trading volume focuses on the range of 360-379 tweets, with a 12.1% chance of occurring, and 400-419 tweets, with a 10.8% chance. The 280-299 tweet range has a 5% chance, indicating a lower probability compared to higher tweet counts. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-of-tweets-december-9-december-16?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese odds suggest that the majority of participants anticipate Musk will post more than 280 tweets between December 9 and December 16, 2025.

Team Spirit has demonstrated exceptional performance throughout the tournament, leading to discussions about their potential to secure the championship title.\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **Stage 3 Dominance:** Team Spirit completed Stage 3 with a flawless 3-0 record, securing their spot in the playoffs. ([esportsinsider.com](https://esportsinsider.com/2025/12/team-spirit-furia-starladder-budapest-major-playoffs?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Playoff Advancement:** In the quarterfinals, Team Spirit defeated Team Falcons 2-0, with standout performances from Ivan \"zweih\" Gogin, who secured an ace on each map.

This market allows bettors to wager on whether the total number of goals scored in a match will be over or under 2.5. A bet on \"Over 2.5 Goals\" wins if the match ends with three or more goals, while a bet on \"Under 2.5 Goals\" wins if the match concludes with two or fewer goals. ([goalsnow.com](https://www.goalsnow.com/over-under-predictions/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Trends and Insights:**\n\n- **League-Specific Patterns:** Certain football leagues exhibit distinct tendencies regarding goal totals. For instance, the German Bundesliga and the Dutch Eredivisie are known for their high-scoring matches, making them favorable for \"Over 2.5 Goals\" bets. Conversely, leagues like Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1 often feature more defensive play, leading to a higher frequency of \"Under 2.5 Goals\" outcomes.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a likely data error in Market 1, as the 85.2% price contradicts the provided 5% probability for that tweet range. For Market 2, all models agree Team Spirit's strong performance justifies a \"YES\" trade with a significant positive edge over the 29% market price. Regarding Market 3, analysts uniformly recommend \"NO_TRADE\" due to a lack of specific match information, resulting in no calculable edge.",

Historical data suggests Musk tweets much more prolifically. The 85.2% price is a severe mispricing, but I need 10%+ edge to recommend NO trade. However, this appears to be showing the NO price (85.2% that he WON'T hit 280-299), which would make YES only 14.8%. If YES is 14.8% and true probability is 5-8%, that's only 6-9% edge - insufficient for trade recommendation.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.55 (16% edge \u00d7 3.45 payout ratio)\nReasoning: Team Spirit has shown dominant form with 3-0 Stage 3 record and 2-0 quarterfinal victory with exceptional individual performances. They've reached the grand final (Dec 14), making them one of only two teams who can win. With 50/50 odds between two finalists, 29% market price significantly undervalues their chances given their tournament momentum and playoff dominance.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.04 (minimal edge)\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 match between Team Spirit and Vitality. Without specific team form data, recent head-to-head records, or map pool analysis for this particular matchup, the 50/50 market price seems approximately fair. The 2% edge is well below the 10% threshold required for a trade recommendation.",

The 85.2% price shown appears to be a data error or I'm misreading the market structure. Based on Musk's typical high-volume posting behavior and market consensus expecting 350+ tweets, the probability of landing exactly in 280-299 is very low.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +13%\nExpected Value: 13% \u00d7 ~2.45x payout = +31.9% EV\n\nReasoning: Team Spirit has shown dominant form with a flawless 3-0 Stage 3 record and convincing 2-0 quarterfinal victory. They're in the grand final (tomorrow, Dec 14), meaning they're one of only 2 teams remaining - base probability should be ~50%. Their momentum and standout performances suggest they're slight favorites or at minimum coinflip, making 29% significantly underpriced.\n\n**MARKET 2: YES**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match)**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (best-of-3 format based on the link). Over 2.5 games means the match goes to 3 maps. Without specific team matchup data or recent head-to-head information, I estimate slightly above 50% for a full 3-game series in competitive CS2, but the edge is insufficient to recommend a trade.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",
