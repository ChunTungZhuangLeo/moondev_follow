  "consensus_summary": "The AI models largely agree that Market 1's high \"No\" probability is reasonable given geopolitical risks, though they disagree on the exact true probability, resulting in no consensus for a high-edge trade. For Market 2, there is strong agreement that the implied probability for \"Over\" is significantly overvalued, with most models recommending a \"No\" bet. In Market 3, opinions are split on the Jazz's first-half moneyline, leading to no clear trading consensus.",

With Netanyahu facing legal pressures, Khamenei's advanced age (85), and general geopolitical instability, there's meaningful risk one leader exits. However, with only ~2.5 weeks remaining, the probability of status quo is still high. The 91% price seems slightly optimistic but within reasonable range.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 89%\nEdge: -34% (55% - 89%)\nExpected Value: 34% \u00d7 ~1.12 = ~38% return on NO bet\nReasoning: An 89% implied probability for the over is extremely high. NBA totals typically hit around 50-55% regardless of the line. While Ja Morant returning could boost scoring, the Jazz play at a slower pace and the Grizzlies have been winning without high-scoring games recently. This market appears severely mispriced - the over should be closer to a coin flip.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 38%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -18% (38% - 56%)\nExpected Value: 18% \u00d7 ~1.79 = ~32% return on NO (Grizzlies 1H)\nReasoning: The Grizzlies are 6.5 point favorites for the full game and have won 7 of their last 9. Home teams typically start strong, and Memphis has been dominant. A 56% probability for the Jazz 1H moneyline seems too high given Memphis's recent form and home court advantage. The Grizzlies should be favored in the first half as well.",

      "response": "# Polymarket Market Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 91.0%\nEdge: -83% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Market asks if ALL 7 leaders remain in power through Dec 31, 2025. With Netanyahu facing political instability, potential health issues for Khamenei (84 years old), and Ukraine war dynamics, probability of ALL surviving is very low. However, market already prices this correctly at 91% \"No\" (9% all survive). No edge available.\n\n**Note:** I'm interpreting \"91% market price\" as 91% probability the market resolves to \"No\" (meaning at least one leader exits). If this is the \"Yes\" price (all survive), then YES would be a strong bet, but context suggests 91% is the \"No\" side.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 89.0%\nEdge: -17% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Negative\nReasoning: Both teams play fast pace. Grizzlies averaging 117+ PPG with strong offense even without Morant. Jazz allowing 120+ PPG defensively (worst in league). Total of 233.5 is high but achievable. However, market at 89% already overprices the Over. The Under offers better value here, but not enough edge (only 17%) to meet the 10% threshold for a contrarian NO bet.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge exists on Under side but only 17%, below our 10% minimum threshold.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 56.0%\nEdge: -21% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +21% \u00d7 payout\nReasoning: Market shows 56% for Jazz 1H moneyline, but Grizzlies are 6.5-point favorites and have won 7 of last 9 games. Grizzlies historically strong first-half team, especially at home. Ja Morant potentially returning adds upside. Jazz are tanking (worst record in West). Market significantly overvalues Jazz at 56% - true probability closer to 35%.\n\n**Decision: NO** - Bet against Jazz (for Grizzlies) with 21% edge.",
