However, the outcome against Rak\u00f3w Czestochowa remains uncertain given the lack of specific performance data on Rak\u00f3w. Without clear indications of either team's superiority, a decision cannot be confidently made.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: There is no current evidence or credible announcements suggesting that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro will resign by December 31, 2026. Despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. actions, Maduro has shown resilience in maintaining power, making a resignation unlikely without further developments.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: While Elon Musk is known for his high Twitter activity, there is insufficient data regarding his specific tweeting behavior for the week in question.

      "response": "**MARKET 1: NO**\nReasoning: Om\u00f3noia faces Rak\u00f3w Czestochowa, a strong Polish side, in the UEFA Conference League. While Om\u00f3noia leads their domestic league, their recent UCL form (1-1 draw away) and playing against a typically competitive European opponent makes a win uncertain. The heavy trading on No ($2,106) suggests market sentiment agrees.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO**\nReasoning: Despite increased U.S. pressure including oil tanker seizures and military buildup, Maduro has survived similar challenges for years and shows no signs of leaving power. Authoritarian leaders rarely resign voluntarily, and there's no credible evidence of imminent regime change within the 13-month timeframe.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**\nReasoning: This is a narrow range prediction (140-159 tweets over 7 days, ~20-23/day) requiring precise knowledge of Musk's posting habits. Without specific data on his current weekly tweet averages during this exact period, this is essentially a lottery ticket among multiple outcome buckets.",

The recent $2,106 bet on No suggests informed skepticism, and without clear odds or Rak\u00f3w's recent form data, this lacks edge.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite U.S. sanctions and oil tanker seizures increasing pressure, Maduro has survived similar challenges for years with military and institutional support. The recent actions show escalation but no credible path to his departure within 14 months, making the No position safer.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The 140-159 tweet range for an 8-day period averages 17.5-20 tweets per day, which appears to be a moderate estimate for Musk. The recent $1,520 bet on No suggests this specific range may be too narrow, as Musk's posting patterns tend to be more variable and often exceed such ranges.",
