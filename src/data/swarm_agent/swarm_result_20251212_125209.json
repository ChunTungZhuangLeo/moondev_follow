A key U.S. proposal includes the creation of a \"free economic zone\" in Ukraine-controlled eastern Donbas areas, which Russia wants Ukraine to cede. Under this plan, Ukrainian forces would withdraw, and the area would become a demilitarized zone without Russian military presence or a clear governance plan. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a public referendum on any territorial concessions.

Overall, the AI models show high agreement on Lighter, disagreement on Almanak, and cautious skepticism regarding the geopolitical outcome.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain with both optimistic and challenging developments. The proposed peace framework and territorial concessions add complexity, and without clear progress or agreement, predicting a ceasefire by 2026 is speculative.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Almanak has secured substantial funding and is backed by prominent investors, indicating strong market confidence. Given its innovative approach and the significant interest it has generated, it's likely to achieve a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) above $50 million shortly after launch.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Lighter has demonstrated rapid growth and significant trading volumes, with metrics that rival major platforms. With strong market activity suggesting high confidence in its potential, it is likely that Lighter's FDV will exceed $2 billion one day after launch.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While there are active peace negotiations and proposals (including Ukraine's 20-point framework and U.S. mediation efforts), the timeline to end-2026 is long with many uncertainties. The recent $599 bet on No suggests skepticism, and territorial disputes remain deeply contentious requiring referendums.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The recent $861 bet on No appears well-informed. While Almanak secured $8.45M in funding from quality investors, this relatively modest raise suggests a lower valuation baseline. The 30% team allocation and typical DeFi token launches rarely achieve $50M+ FDV immediately without exceptional hype or fundamentals.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Lighter's metrics are exceptional - $1.2B TVL, $2.2B open interest, and $8.5B daily volume as of October 2025, rivaling Hyperliquid. The market trades at 68% Yes with $15M volume, and the recent $1,500 Yes bet aligns with strong fundamentals supporting a $2B+ FDV at launch.",
