  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no trade for Market 1, as all models agree the high market price accurately reflects Mendoza's near-certain Heisman win. For Markets 2 and 3, there is significant disagreement on edge calculations, with only AI #3 identifying a 10%+ opportunity (a YES on Market 2). The overall analysis suggests most perceived edges are minimal, with Market 2 being the sole candidate for a potential trade based on one dissenting, more bullish evaluation.",
