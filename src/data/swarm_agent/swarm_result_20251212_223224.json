Crystal Palace secured a 2-1 victory, with Marc Guehi scoring a decisive header in the 87th minute. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/rutter-rescues-point-brighton-with-late-equaliser-against-west-ham-2025-12-07/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis outcome is significant for betting markets, particularly for the Fulham FC (-1.5) spread. A -1.5 spread means Fulham needed to win by at least two goals to cover the bet. Since Fulham lost the match, they failed to cover the spread.\n\nPrior to this match, Fulham had a mixed record, including a 3-0 home win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on November 1, 2025. ([fulhamweb.co.uk](https://www.fulhamweb.co.uk/results.aspx?utm_source=openai)) However, their recent form has been inconsistent, with losses to Everton and Arsenal in November 2025.

The auction is scheduled to begin on January 12, 2026, and conclude on January 15, 2026, with token distribution starting on January 20, 2026. ([zama.org](https://www.zama.org/post/announcing-the-zama-public-auction?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe auction will utilize a sealed-bid Dutch auction format on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging Zama's own protocol to ensure bid confidentiality through FHE. This approach aims to provide fair distribution, accurate price discovery, and prevent issues like bot interference and gas wars.

The Seahawks are favored by 13.5 points, marking them as significant favorites in this matchup.\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n\n- **Seattle Seahawks:** The Seahawks have demonstrated strong form, winning three consecutive games and seven of their last eight. Notably, they have outscored their opponents 63-9 in their past two games, showcasing a dominant defense that has not allowed a touchdown in the last two outings.

Their starting quarterback, Daniel Jones, suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, leading the team to sign 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement. Additionally, rookie quarterback Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

However, their inconsistency and recent loss against Crystal Palace reduce confidence in a strong victory margin. The edge is not sufficient for a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 5%  \nMarket Price: 95.8%  \nEdge: -90.8% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -0.908 \u00d7 $0.042 = -$0.0381  \nReasoning: Although Zama plans to launch its token, the auction is scheduled for January 2026, which means the token will not launch in 2025.

Fulham's recent form is inconsistent with losses to mid-table teams, and away matches against motivated opponents rarely produce 2+ goal margins. The market seems roughly fair.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -90.8% (5% - 95.8%)\nExpected Value: Very high on NO side\nReasoning: The news explicitly states Zama's token auction begins January 12, 2026, with distribution starting January 20, 2026 - all dates are in 2026, NOT 2025. The market asks about 2025 launch, which is now impossible.

However, this appears to be about a FUTURE match (BUR-FUL on 2025-12-13). Fulham's recent form is poor (losses to Palace, Everton, Arsenal), and covering -1.5 against Burnley requires winning by 2+ goals. Market at 26% seems roughly appropriate given inconsistent form.

Colts lost 4 of last 5 and their starting QB has a season-ending injury, forcing them to sign 44-year-old retired Philip Rivers. This is a massive mismatch. 13.5 points is steep but Seahawks' defensive dominance and Colts' QB crisis make this very coverable.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET YES - HIGH CONVICTION**",
