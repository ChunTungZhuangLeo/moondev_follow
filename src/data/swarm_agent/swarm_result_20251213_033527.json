The market is divided into different tweet count ranges, each with associated probabilities:\n\n- **280-299 tweets**: 5% chance of occurring.\n- **300-319 tweets**: 8% chance.\n- **320-339 tweets**: 9% chance.\n- **340-359 tweets**: 10% chance.\n- **360-379 tweets**: 12% chance.\n- **400-419 tweets**: 11% chance.\n- **420-439 tweets**: 10% chance.\n\nThese probabilities indicate that the majority of participants anticipate a higher tweet count than the 280-299 range.

Team Spirit has demonstrated strong performance throughout the tournament, securing a spot in the semifinals after defeating Team Falcons 2-0 in the quarterfinals.

A bet on \"Over 2.5\" wins if the match ends with 3 or more goals, while a bet on \"Under 2.5\" wins if there are 2 or fewer goals scored.

For instance, the Dutch Eredivisie and the German Bundesliga have high average goals per game, making them favorable for over 2.5 goals bets. Conversely, leagues like the French Ligue 1 and the Japanese J-League tend to have lower scoring games, making under 2.5 goals bets more appealing.

For Market 2, opinions are split between seeing a small edge below the 10% threshold and a significant one, leading to mixed \"YES\" and \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations.

The 85.2% market price appears to be a display error or I'm misreading the market - the actual probability for this narrow range should be around 5-8%. If the market truly shows 85.2% for YES, this is a massive mispricing.\n\n**MARKET 1: NO**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Team Spirit win the StarLadder Budapest Major 2025?**\n\nYour Probability: 32%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +3%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: Team Spirit is in the semifinals after beating Falcons 2-0, showing strong form. With 4 teams remaining (semifinals stage), a baseline probability would be 25%. Their strong performance, high viewership, and pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (implying ~18%) suggest they're performing above expectations. However, they still need to win 2 more best-of-3 series. The 29% price seems reasonably accurate.\n\n**MARKET 2: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Games Total: O/U 2.5 (CS2 match)**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5%\nExpected Value: Insufficient edge\n\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 esports match (likely Team Spirit vs Vitality based on the URL). In CS2 best-of-3 matches at Major playoffs, competitive teams often go to 3 maps. However, Spirit has been dominant (2-0 vs Falcons). Without specific head-to-head data between these teams, the 50/50 split is reasonable. My slight lean to Over isn't strong enough for a trade.\n\n**MARKET 3: NO_TRADE**",

The 85.2% price appears to be an error or misread - this should be trading much lower. However, without current tweet count data (we're on Dec 13, midway through the period), I cannot confidently estimate the true probability.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Data inconsistency suggests potential platform error or misunderstanding of the market structure.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Team Spirit Wins StarLadder Budapest Major 2025**\n\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 29.0%\nEdge: +16.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +16% \u00d7 $1 = $0.16 per dollar wagered\nReasoning: Team Spirit is IN THE SEMIFINALS with the grand final on Dec 14 (tomorrow). They defeated Falcons 2-0, lead in viewership (560k avg), and had pre-tournament odds of 5.50 (15-18% implied). Being in final four with strong form means ~40-50% win probability, significantly higher than 29% market price.\n\n**Decision: YES** - Strong edge with Team Spirit already in semifinals and showing dominant form.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO_TRADE\n**CS2 Team Spirit vs Vitality O/U 2.5 Games**\n\nYour Probability: 55%\nMarket Price: 50.0%\nEdge: +5.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +5% \u00d7 $1 = $0.05 per dollar wagered\nReasoning: This appears to be a CS2 semifinal match (Team Spirit vs Vitality) at the Budapest Major. Best-of-3 semifinals typically go to 3 games when teams are evenly matched. Recent $990 bet on Over suggests sharp money, but 5% edge is insufficient for recommended trade.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** - Edge below 10% threshold despite slight value on Over.",
