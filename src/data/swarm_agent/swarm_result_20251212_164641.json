Given the close standings and recent results, this match is difficult to predict with confidence.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Although the Tampa Bay Lightning recently won convincingly against the New Jersey Devils, they are dealing with key injuries, including the loss of captain Victor Hedman. Meanwhile, the Islanders have won the previous two encounters against the Lightning this season and have home advantage, making them more likely to win this matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: With 15 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher already recorded by December 12, 2025, and over six months remaining until June 30, 2026, it is highly probable that there will be at least eight more such earthquakes, given historical averages.",

The significant trade on \"No\" ($779.76) reflects this sentiment.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Despite the Islanders winning the previous two matchups this season, the Lightning are coming off a dominant 8-4 win showing offensive firepower with Kucherov in excellent form (4 assists). Tampa Bay has the talent to break through despite Hedman's injury, and home/away dynamics favor a Lightning bounce-back.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: There have already been 15 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0+ in 2025 as of December 12, which far exceeds the threshold of 8 by June 30. This market should resolve YES since the condition has already been met - the question is whether this market refers to 2025 or 2026, but either way, 8+ major earthquakes by mid-year is highly likely given historical averages of ~16 per year.",

The recent head-to-head history favors the Islanders, but the Lightning's offensive explosion creates conflicting signals.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: There have already been 15 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0+ in 2025 as of December 12, which far exceeds the threshold of 8 by June 30.
