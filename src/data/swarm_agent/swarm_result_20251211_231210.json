  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"No\" for Musk's tweet volume due to the low market probability and cyberattack disruption, while the hockey game shows split opinions between \"Over\" and \"No Trade\" due to conflicting offensive momentum and injury impacts. For the 2028 election, responses are divided between \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and \"No Trade,\" reflecting agreement on Vance's strong early positioning but major uncertainty given the distant timeline.

However, the uncertainty due to Victor Hedman's absence for the Lightning complicates the prediction, making it a less clear betting opportunity.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: JD Vance has received strong endorsements from influential political figures like President Trump and Marco Rubio, indicating substantial support within the party for his candidacy.

While Musk is prolific, this threshold is exceptionally high, and the cyberattack on X may have disrupted normal posting patterns.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lightning vs. Devils: O/U 5.5**\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Both teams just came off high-scoring games (Lightning won 6-1, Devils won 4-3), suggesting offensive momentum.

The recent $960 No trade aligns with this assessment that 500+ tweets in 8 days is unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams just broke long losing streaks with high-scoring wins (Lightning 6-1, Devils 4-3), but Lightning lost key defenseman Hedman to injury. Mixed signals make this total unpredictable, and the recent $750 Over trade suggests market is already pricing in offensive expectations.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Vance has Trump's endorsement and Rubio's support as of late 2025, we're still 3+ years from the 2028 election with enormous uncertainty ahead.
