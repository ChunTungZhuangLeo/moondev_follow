The most recent development in Meta's AI model lineup is the Llama 4 series, which faced delays due to performance issues, particularly in reasoning and mathematical tasks. ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/meta-delays-llama-4-ai-model-release-amid-development-challenges--the-information-93CH-3968615?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, Meta is reportedly developing a successor to the Llama series, codenamed \"Avocado,\" with a target release in the first quarter of 2026. This new model may adopt a closed-source approach to directly compete with proprietary models from OpenAI and others. ([news.aibase.com](https://news.aibase.com/news/23528?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven these developments, the release of Llama 5 in 2025 appears unlikely.

The lack of clear, decisive form for either team makes it difficult to predict the outcome with confidence.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Aston Villa is in excellent form, having recently defeated Arsenal and maintained a strong winning streak, including Europa League success.
