Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, heavy fighting has continued along their disputed 817-km border. Cambodia reported ongoing bombings by Thai forces, while Thailand accused Cambodia of violating international law by targeting civilian areas and using landmines. Both Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Premier Hun Manet have not confirmed any ceasefire agreement, and the conflict has intensified, marking the most severe fighting since a brief clash in July.

  "consensus_summary": "Consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Thailand capturing the temple and for NVIDIA reaching $228, citing the entrenched conflict and the stock's large required price surge as decisive. For the Giannis trade, most responses lean \"NO,\" but there is notable disagreement, with one model seeing enough uncertainty to recommend \"NO_TRADE\" and another seeing value in a contrarian \"YES\" bet. Overall, the predictions are most confident and unified on Markets 1 and 3, while Market 2 presents the highest uncertainty and divergence in interpretation.",

The persistent conflict and lack of agreement suggest that Thailand will not capture the temple by December 31.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Although discussions between Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks are ongoing, there is no clear indication of a trade to the Toronto Raptors. The mutual interest reported earlier in the year and the lack of a formal trade request from Antetokounmpo create uncertainty, making it prudent to refrain from taking a position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: NVIDIA's stock is trading significantly below $228 at $175.02, with recent declines influenced by broader AI sector volatility. Given the current price and market conditions, it is unlikely that NVIDIA will reach $228 in December.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news indicates an intensifying conflict with no confirmed ceasefire, making Thailand capturing the temple by Dec 31 highly improbable. However, the market is already heavily skewed towards 'No' at $886.42, offering negligible upside for a 'No' bet.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Despite the market heavily favoring 'No', recent news indicates that Giannis and the Bucks are actively discussing his future, including a potential trade before the February 1 deadline, and there's reported mutual interest with the Raptors. This suggests the probability of a trade to the Raptors might be higher than the market's implied ~10%.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: NVIDIA's stock is currently at $175.02 and needs to surge over 30% to reach $228 by the end of December. Recent news indicates a decline due to AI sector volatility and concerns about an \"AI bubble,\" making such a rapid, significant increase highly unlikely.

      "response": "Here are my predictions for each market:\n\nMARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Despite ongoing heavy fighting between Thailand and Cambodia along their border, capturing a UNESCO World Heritage temple would be an extreme escalation with massive international consequences. The conflict appears to be border skirmishes rather than a coordinated military campaign to seize the temple, and with only 18 days remaining in December, a full capture is highly unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While there's reported mutual interest between Giannis and the Raptors, the news indicates Antetokounmpo has not made a formal trade request and the Bucks are proceeding as if he'll stay. A superstar trade of this magnitude typically requires more concrete movement toward a deal than currently exists, and the trade deadline isn't until February.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: NVIDIA is currently trading at $175.02, which would require a 30%+ increase to reach $228 in the remaining ~18 days of December. With recent AI sector volatility, concerns about overvaluation, and the stock actually declining, such a dramatic rally is extremely unlikely in this timeframe.",

Both governments haven't confirmed ceasefire but capture by Dec 31 remains extremely unlikely.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: While discussions about Giannis's future have occurred, there's no indication of imminent trade talks specifically with Toronto, and ESPN reported the Bucks are proceeding assuming he stays. Trade deadline isn't until February 1, making an immediate Raptors trade unlikely without concrete reporting.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: NVDA is currently at $175.02, requiring a 30% gain to reach $228 in the remaining ~18 days of December. Recent negative momentum from AI sector concerns and 3.25% decline make this extreme rally highly improbable in such a short timeframe.",
