The concept of Jesus' Second Coming is a central tenet in Christian eschatology, but specific predictions about its timing vary widely and are often speculative.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Public Opinion:** A 2010 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 41% of Americans believed Jesus would return by 2050, while 46% disagreed. ([pewresearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2010/07/14/jesus-christs-return-to-earth/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Prediction Markets:** In 2025, the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket hosted a market on the likelihood of Jesus' return by December 31, 2025. The majority of participants bet against this event, with only about 3% wagering on its occurrence.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-launches-gold-card-program-expedited-visas-with-1-million-price-tag-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai)) This initiative, announced on December 10, 2025, is designed to attract affluent foreign nationals and generate significant revenue for the U.S. Treasury. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/22edbd7e65d188bbf6c8ec1d5f78d11a?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe program has been met with mixed reactions. Critics argue that it creates a pay-to-play system, potentially undermining the broader immigration system and raising concerns about legal challenges. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/12/trump-gold-card-visa-website-h1b?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, the program's legality under current U.S. immigration law remains uncertain.

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO  \nReasoning: There is no credible evidence or official announcement suggesting Jesus Christ will return before 2027. The concept is highly speculative and largely based on faith rather than empirical data. Historical betting trends also show a strong bias against such an event occurring within specific timelines.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: The recent launch of the \"Gold Card\" program by the Trump administration, which offers expedited residency for a $1 million contribution, makes it likely that at least 1-100 Gold Cards will be sold in 2025. The program is designed to attract affluent individuals, and despite legal uncertainties, the financial incentive and high-profile launch suggest initial sales are probable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen has shown strong recent performances, including significant victories, making the -2.5 spread achievable. However, without specific information about the opponent in the upcoming match, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of Bayern covering the spread confidently. Therefore, no trade is recommended without further details.",

This is a clear NO bet based on the lack of any verifiable indicators.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The Trump administration officially launched the Gold Card program on December 10-11, 2025, with a $1 million price tag for expedited residency. Given Trump's history with branded products and the program's official launch, selling 1-100 cards by year-end is highly probable.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Bayern is in exceptional form with a 5-0 win over Stuttgart, 3-1 comeback vs Sporting, and an 11-point Bundesliga lead. Their recent performances show they're capable of covering a -2.5 spread, especially with Harry Kane scoring hat-tricks.",

This is essentially a 97%+ probability NO based on historical precedent of all such predictions failing and the speculative nature of eschatological timing claims.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: The Gold Card program officially launched on December 10, 2025 with significant media attention, and given the high-profile nature and wealthy target demographic, selling between 1-100 cards in the remaining ~3 weeks of 2025 is highly probable - even a handful of early adopters would satisfy this threshold.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: While Bayern Munich is in excellent form (5-0 vs Stuttgart, 3-1 vs Sporting), a -2.5 spread requires winning by 3+ goals which is a high bar even against weaker opponents. Without knowing the specific opponent and given the inherent volatility of covering large spreads, this represents elevated risk that doesn't warrant a confident position.",
