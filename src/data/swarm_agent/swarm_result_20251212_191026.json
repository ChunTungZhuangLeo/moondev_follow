Their recent 5-2 loss to Boston shows defensive vulnerabilities, and while they beat Ottawa 2-1, that margin wouldn't cover this spread. NHL puck line favorites cover roughly 30-35% of the time historically.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Dota 2: Heroic vs Pipsqueak+4 - Game 1 Winner**\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: -5.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Not significant\nReasoning: Both teams have identical 2-5 recent records, suggesting more parity than the 97% community vote implies. Heroic is the better team historically, but Pipsqueak+4's recent 2-1 win over Passion UA shows they're competitive. Game 1s can be volatile, and 77.8% seems slightly high given the form convergence.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Will Eintracht Braunschweig win on 2025-12-12?**\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -57.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Massive edge on NO side (~5.8x return on NO)\nReasoning: This market price is absurdly wrong. Braunschweig is 14th in 2. Bundesliga playing AWAY at Dresden (17th). Their recent form shows 1 win in 5 matches. Away wins in 2. Bundesliga typically have ~25-35% probability even for favored teams.

Their recent form is inconsistent (lost to Boston badly, beat Ottawa 2-1). The -1.5 spread is challenging - they need to win by 2+ goals. Market price of 33% seems fairly efficient given their shaky recent performance.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 80%\nMarket Price: 77.8%\nEdge: +2.2% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Low - insufficient edge\nReasoning: Heroic is clearly favored with 97% community prediction, but both teams have identical 2-3 records in last 5 matches. Pipsqueak+4 just beat Passion UA 2-1, showing they can compete. The 77.8% market price already reflects Heroic's advantage appropriately - this is fairly priced with minimal edge available.\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 92.8%\nEdge: -47.8% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High on NO side (47.8% \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: This market is SEVERELY mispriced. Braunschweig is 14th place visiting 17th place Dresden - both teams are struggling with poor form (Braunschweig: 1W-1D-3L in last 5). Dresden has home advantage and similar recent results (2W-3L). A 92.8% probability implies Braunschweig should be overwhelming favorites, but this is essentially a toss-up between two struggling lower-table teams. The recent $5,000 YES trade appears to have created a massive overreaction. **STRONG BET NO.**",
