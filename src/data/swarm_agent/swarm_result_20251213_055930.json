In a recent comparison, Claude 4.5 Sonnet outperformed Elon Musk's Grok 4.1 in six out of nine categories, notably in reasoning, technical communication, and ethical nuance. ([tomsguide.com](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-4-1-vs-anthropics-claude-4-5-sonnet-heres-the-ai-model-thats-actually-smarter?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, other AI models have also achieved significant advancements in mathematical reasoning. For instance, Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think, released five days ago, has been reported to excel in complex reasoning tasks, including mathematics, science, and logic. ([androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-deep-think-is-now-available-in-the-gemini-app-but-only-for-subscribers?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, a small AI startup named Poetiq recently outperformed Googl...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Brisbane Roar FC win on 2025-12-13?\nRecent trade: $1,804.20 on Yes\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/aus-wsw-bri-2025-12-13\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nBrisbane Roar FC is set to face Western Sydney Wanderers FC on December 13, 2025, at CommBank Stadium in Sydney.

([thetopbookies.com](https://www.thetopbookies.com/betting-tips/football/wsw-vs-bri-13-dec-2025?utm_source=openai))\n  - On a five-match unbeaten streak, featuring victories over Melbourne Victory (1-0) and Newcastle Jets (3-0), and a 1-0 away win against Adelaide United. ([thetopbookies.com](https://www.thetopbookies.com/betting-tips/football/wsw-vs-bri-13-dec-2025?utm_source=openai))\n  - Boasts the league's best defensive record, conceding only three goals.

Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had previously missed domestic games against Olympique Lyonnais and Le Havre due to a calf injury. His absence could affect PSG's attacking capabilities. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/psgs-dembele-out-athletic-bilbao-clash-2025-12-09/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9:** The 20-year-old midfielder suffered a serious muscle injury on October 29, 2025, sidelining him for approximately eight weeks. PSG plans to send Dou\u00e9 to Doha for rehabilitation, similar to the program that aided Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's recovery earlier this year. Dou\u00e9's absence may limit midfield options for coach Luis Enrique. ([s...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "All three AI models unanimously recommend **NO_TRADE** for Market 1 due to high uncertainty from recent competitive AI releases, **YES** for Market 2 based on Brisbane Roar's strong form and defensive record, and **NO** for Market 3 because PSG's key injuries make covering a -2.5 goal spread unlikely. There is complete agreement across all three predictions with no disagreements. This presents a clear consensus for each market.",

The presence of other emerging competitors like Poetiq makes it uncertain whether Anthropic will maintain the lead in AI for math by the end of 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: Brisbane Roar FC is currently in excellent form, with a strong defensive record and a five-match unbeaten streak. They are second in the league standings, which suggests a good chance of victory against Western Sydney Wanderers FC, especially given their recent performances.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: PSG's recent challenges, including key injuries to players like Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, are likely to impact their performance. Given these setbacks, covering a -2.5 spread against FC Metz could be difficult, making a \"No\" bet more favorable.",
