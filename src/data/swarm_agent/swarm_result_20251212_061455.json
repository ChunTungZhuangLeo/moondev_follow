The Democratic plan aimed to extend the subsidies for three years, while the Republican proposal focused on health savings accounts. Neither proposal garnered the necessary 60 votes to pass, leading to concerns about significant premium increases for millions of Americans starting in January. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/969a94c7348897db851ec6cc09f4fff6?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe expiration of these subsidies is projected to more than double average premiums for ACA Marketplace enrollees in 2026. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that premiums could rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026. This substantial increase may result in approximately 4 million people dropping their health coverage.

CEO Jason Robins highlighted this initiative as a significant opportunity to expand the company's total addressable market, particularly in states where DraftKings does not currently offer a sportsbook.

Robins noted that nearly half of the U.S. population still lacks access to regulated online sports betting, presenting a substantial market opportunity.

Recent developments indicate ongoing diplomatic efforts, but significant challenges remain.\n\n**U.S.-Led Peace Negotiations:**\nThe United States has been actively involved in facilitating peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy revealed that Ukraine has submitted a revised 20-point peace framework to the U.S., addressing key issues such as territorial concessions in Donbas. The U.S. has proposed establishing a \"free economic zone\" in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donbas, which Russia seeks to control. Zelenskyy emphasized that any territorial concessions would require a public referendum.

The news shows ACA credits have already failed to be extended in 2025, making the first condition impossible, so the true probability is near 0%.

The ACA credits just failed in Senate (December 12, 2025) and won't pass before Dec 31 expiration - this alone makes the probability near 0%. Even if Republicans have decent 2026 House odds (~40-50%), multiplying gives ~0% total probability. The market is severely mispriced at 95% YES.\n\n**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** This should be a strong NO bet, but I need to verify the question structure. If this is asking for BOTH events, the edge is massive (-87%) favoring NO. However, 95% price seems illogical for a compound question, suggesting possible market confusion about resolution criteria. **NO_TRADE** until resolution criteria are clarified, then likely strong NO.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\n**Market:** DraftKings launches prediction market in 2025\n**Your Probability:** 85%\n**Market Price:** 67.0%\n**Edge:** +18% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive (+18% \u00d7 payout = significant EV)\n\n**Reasoning:** DraftKings CEO explicitly announced \"DraftKings Predictions\" launching \"in the coming months\" during Q3 2025 earnings. They acquired prediction market company in October 2025. With only 2-3 weeks left in 2025, \"coming months\" timeline from Q3 strongly suggests December launch. The infrastructure is ready post-acquisition.\n\n**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** **YES** - Strong edge of +18% with concrete evidence of imminent launch.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\n**Market:** Zelenskyy talks to Putin by December 31\n**Your Probability:** 2%\n**Market Price:** 97.6%\n**Edge:** -95.6% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Massive positive on NO side\n\n**Reasoning:** Zero evidence of any scheduled call/meeting in next 19 days. Zelenskyy submitted peace framework to US (not Russia), negotiations are US-mediated, and Lavrov's recent statements show no direct dialogue planned. With active war and no diplomatic breakthrough, a direct Putin-Zelenskyy conversation by Dec 31 is extremely unlikely (~2% probability).\n\n**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** **NO** - Exceptional edge of 95.6%. Market appears to have misread the question or news. This is the strongest contrarian opportunity of the three markets.",
