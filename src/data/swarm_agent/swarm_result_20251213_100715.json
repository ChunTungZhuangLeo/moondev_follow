Consequently, prediction markets such as Polymarket have established markets to speculate on the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of Theo's token one day after its hypothetical launch. For instance, a market titled \"Theo FDV above ___ one day after launch?\" includes various FDV thresholds, with the $700 million option currently priced at 29% probability, indicating a 71% chance of the FDV being below $700 million one day after launch.

The market's current pricing reflects the collective uncertainty and speculative nature...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: 76ers vs. Hawks\nRecent trade: $1,000.00 on 76ers\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/nba-phi-atl-2025-12-14\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are set to face the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday, December 14, 2025, at 6 p.m. EST in Atlanta.

In contrast, the Hawks have been inconsistent, as evidenced by their recent heavy loss to the Pistons. The momentum favors the 76ers extending their road win streak.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Getafe has consistently scored in their recent matches, and with Espanyol in good form and likely to be competitive, it is plausible that both teams will find the back of the net. The recent form and scoring patterns suggest a strong possibility for both teams to score.",
