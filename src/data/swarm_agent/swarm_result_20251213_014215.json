  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a potential 10%+ edge only in Market 3, with three AIs recommending a \"YES\" trade on the Jazz first-half moneyline due to Ja Morant's questionable status. For Markets 1 and 2, all analysts agree there is insufficient positive edge to recommend a trade, generally viewing their respective \"Yes\" and \"Over\" prices as overvalued. There is notable disagreement on the magnitude of edge in Market 2, with probability estimates for the \"Over\" ranging from 58% to 85% against the 89% market price.",

Given the lack of significant recent geopolitical crises affecting these leaders, the probability is reasonable, and there's insufficient edge for a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 70%  \nMarket Price: 89.0%  \nEdge: -19% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -0.19 \u00d7 Payout  \nReasoning: While both teams have been performing well, the absence of key player Zach Edey for the Grizzlies might dampen overall scoring potential. Coupled with the unpredictable nature of sports outcomes, the market's high probability for the over seems excessive, presenting an opportunity to bet on the under.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE  \nYour Probability: 55%  \nMarket Price: 56.0%  \nEdge: -1% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -0.01 \u00d7 Payout  \nReasoning: The potential return of Ja Morant for the Grizzlies could significantly influence the game's first half, making the outcome uncertain.

Netanyahu faces legal pressures, Khamenei is 85+ years old with health concerns, and Zelenskyy operates in a war zone. However, \"out of power\" is a high bar.

The Jazz are one of the worst teams in the NBA, and while Memphis has been hot, Zach Edey is out and Ja Morant is questionable. Utah games have been inconsistent in hitting high totals. The market appears to be heavily skewed by recent momentum betting. 233.5 is a high line, and under should hit roughly 40-45% of the time even in favorable conditions.\n\n**Decision: NO (bet Under)**\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline**\n\nYour Probability: 62%\nMarket Price: 56% (for Jazz)\nEdge: -6% for Jazz / +6% for Grizzlies\n\nReasoning: The market shows 56% for Jazz, but Memphis is the significantly better team at home, has won 7 of 9 recently, and Ja Morant may return. Jazz are rebuilding with rookies. Memphis should be favored in the first half at home around 60-65%. However, the edge for Grizzlies is only ~6%, below threshold.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE**",

Trump just took office, Putin/Khamenei are entrenched autocrats, and parliamentary leaders face no confidence votes imminent.

Memphis averaging 115 ppg, Utah around 110 ppg. Total of 233.5 is high - expecting ~228-230 range.

Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games and historically starts strong at home. Ja Morant likely returning adds significant boost. Jazz are rebuilding team (poor road record) while Grizzlies are 12-4 at home. The recent $1,130 bet on Jazz appears to be creating value on Grizzlies side - this is contrarian opportunity where public money on underdog creates edge on favorite.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET YES (Grizzlies 1H) - Strong 12% edge with positive expected value**",
