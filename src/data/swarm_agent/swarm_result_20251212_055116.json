The Colts, currently 8-5, are grappling with significant quarterback injuries. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending torn Achilles during a 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 7. Rookie Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones, is dealing with a knee injury and is listed as week-to-week. With fellow quarterback Anthony Richardson on injured reserve due to an orbital bone injury, the Colts have signed 44-year-old retired quarterback Philip Rivers to their practice squad. Head coach Shane Steichen has not yet announced who will start against the Seahawks, leaving the possibility open for Rivers to play.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1 has a high true probability (65-95%) due to the legal mandate, though opinions vary on whether its 5-35% edge over the 60% market price is worth trading. For Market 2, analysts are split, with some seeing a 10%+ edge betting on the Colts at 13% while others strongly disagree, reflecting high uncertainty from the quarterback crisis. Regarding Market 3, most analysts see no actionable edge, generally estimating a probability near or below the 43% market price.",

This is a legal obligation, not discretionary. The DOJ is legally required to release unclassified documents, and a federal judge has already authorized unsealing grand jury transcripts. The legal framework is in place and the deadline is binding - bureaucratic compliance with signed law is highly probable.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Colts vs. Seahawks**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 13%\nEdge: -1%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: The Colts (8-5) face a devastating QB crisis - Jones out for season, Leonard week-to-week with knee injury, Richardson on IR. They may start 44-year-old Philip Rivers who came out of retirement. Playing in Seattle against a competent Seahawks team with this QB situation is extremely difficult. However, the market already prices this appropriately.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 12%\nMarket Price: 13%\nEdge: -1%\nExpected Value: Not enough edge to trade\nReasoning: Market is correctly pricing the Colts' dire situation.

This appears to resolve the market YES - the seizure has already occurred in 2025. Unless there's a technicality about what counts as \"another\" ship, this market should be near 100%. The 43% price suggests massive mispricing or the market hasn't updated to reflect this news.",

However, there's ~35% risk of technical delays, redactions, or last-minute legal challenges. Edge too small to justify trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 28%\nMarket Price: 13%\nEdge: +15% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+15% \u00d7 7.7x payout = +115% EV)\nReasoning: The market severely underprices Colts' chances despite their 8-5 record. While QB situation is chaotic (Jones out, Leonard injured, possibly 44-year-old Rivers), Seahawks at home aren't dominant enough to justify 87% win probability. Historical data shows backup QBs can be competitive, and 13% implies Colts are near-hopeless, which overreacts to recent news.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 43%\nEdge: -28% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (-28% \u00d7 2.3x payout on NO = +64% EV)\nReasoning: The market question asks about \"ANOTHER\" seizure after the December 10 Skipper seizure. With only 19 days remaining in 2025, and given that such operations require extensive intelligence/coordination, a second seizure is unlikely. The 43% price appears to confuse the recent seizure (already happened) with probability of an additional one. Strong NO edge.",
