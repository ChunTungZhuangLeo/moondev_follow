  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong, agreed-upon edge for Millwall FC (Market 2), with all analysts recommending a \"YES\" trade based on their superior home form. For the other markets, analysts generally agree the Grenoble price (Market 1) is overvalued, though they disagree on whether to trade against it, while the Dota 2 match (Market 3) is seen as too uncertain for a high-conviction trade. Therefore, the only clear, actionable recommendation with a significant edge is to bet on Millwall winning.",

Hull City's inconsistent performance further boosts Millwall\u2019s probability of winning, making a bet on Millwall undervalued by the market.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 40%  \nMarket Price: 51.0%  \nEdge: -11% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -$0.11 (Edge \u00d7 potential payout)  \nReasoning: Both teams have been struggling, but Passion UA's slightly higher ranking and Nemesis's longer losing streak suggest a closer matchup than the market implies. The probability for Passion UA winning seems overestimated, providing value on the NO side.",
