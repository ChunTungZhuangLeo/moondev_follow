Professional betting markets show only 62% probability (1.65 odds) for BTTS, yet Polymarket prices it at 95.9%. This is a massive mispricing, but in the WRONG direction - the market is too bullish on YES. However, the edge favors NO, not YES.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Would recommend NO if that were an option, but insufficient edge on YES side)\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\n**Will the highest temperature in New York City be between 42-43\u00b0F on December 13?**\n\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 86.0%\nEdge: -81.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong negative for YES, strong positive for NO\nReasoning: As of 12:45 PM on December 13, the high is only 40\u00b0F with hourly forecasts showing temperatures declining throughout the day (peaking at 40\u00b0F at 3 PM, then dropping). It's virtually impossible to reach 42-43\u00b0F range.
