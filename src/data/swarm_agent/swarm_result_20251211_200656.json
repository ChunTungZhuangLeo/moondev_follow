Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has presented a revised 20-point peace framework to the United States, which includes the establishment of a \"free economic zone\" in the Ukraine-controlled parts of eastern Donbas. This proposal suggests Ukrainian troop withdrawal, with Russian forces not entering the area, potentially designating it as a \"demilitarized zone.\" However, Zelenskyy emphasized that any territorial concessions should be decided by a national referendum. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-offers-free-economic-zone-east-if-ukraine-cedes-donbas-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-11/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn parallel, Ukraine has agreed to the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Donbas region, a significant concession in ongoing peace talks involving the U.S., Russia, and key European leaders.

This suggests a propensity for games to exceed 2.5 goals, making an \"Over\" outcome more likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Ukraine is in negotiations involving potential territorial concessions, but President Zelenskyy has indicated that such decisions would require a national referendum. The establishment of a demilitarized zone does not necessarily equate to ceding territory, and public approval seems unlikely.",

The statistical trend toward high-scoring matches favors the Over.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While negotiations are ongoing and Ukraine has discussed demilitarized zones, Zelenskyy has emphasized that any territorial concessions require a national referendum, which is unlikely to be organized and completed before year-end. The complexity of these negotiations and democratic requirements make a formal agreement to cede territory in 2025 improbable.",

While 70% of recent games featured both teams scoring, the recent trade heavily favoring Under 2.5 and the tactical nature of Europa League knockout-stage matches suggests a lower-scoring affair is likely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Despite ongoing negotiations and proposals for demilitarized zones, President Zelenskyy has explicitly stated that any territorial concessions must be decided by national referendum. Given Ukrainian public sentiment against ceding territory and the political impossibility of such a referendum passing in 2025, formal territorial cession this year is highly unlikely.",
