This type of bet is common in sports like soccer and hockey, where scoring can vary significantly. ([rantsports.com](https://www.rantsports.com/betting/dictionary/over-45-goals-meaning/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the NHL, Over/Under totals typically range between 5.0 and 6.5 goals, depending on the offensive and defensive strengths of the teams involved. For example, a game with a total set at 5.5 goals would require a combined score of six or more for the \"Over\" to win. ([covers.com](https://www.covers.com/nhl/how-to-bet-hockey?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent NHL games have seen varied scoring outcomes. For instance, on December 11, 2025, the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the New Jersey Devils 8-4, resulting in a total of 12 goals. Similarly, the Detroit Red Wings beat the Calgary Flames 4-3, totaling 7 goals.

Recent polling data indicates that only 2% of Democrats consider her an \"ideal choice\" for the nomination, placing her near the bottom among potential candidates. ([themidwesterner.news](https://www.themidwesterner.news/2025/04/only-2-of-democrats-identify-whitmer-as-ideal-choice-for-2028-presidential-race/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn October 2025, Whitmer stated she would not \"rule out\" a 2028 bid, but emphasized her current focus on her gubernatorial duties and the 2026 midterm elections. ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/gretchen-whitmer-won-t-rule-out-2028-democratic-presidential-bid?utm_source=openai)) However, by November 2025, she had retreated from the national political spotlight, reducing media appearances and campaign activities, leading some to question her commitment to a presidential run.

Recent trends indicate a slight shift towards more matches ending with under 2.5 goals.\n\n**Recent Trends:**\n\n- In December 2025, 55% of matches (20 games) have seen over 2.5 goals, while 45% have seen under 2.5 goals. This is a decrease from November, where 68.6% of matches had over 2.5 goals.

  "consensus_summary": "The AI models unanimously agree that Market 2 is a \"NO\" due to Whitmer's low polling and lack of campaign momentum. For Markets 1 and 3, there is significant disagreement and confusion, as most models note the provided sports betting news is irrelevant to the actual esports events, leading to several \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations. The consensus highlights that predictions for the esports markets are unreliable without proper context, while the political market has clear, negative indicators.",

The market's recent activity also shows a significant amount of money placed on the \"Under,\" but considering the current trend of high scores, \"Over\" seems more plausible.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Gretchen Whitmer's low polling numbers and her retreat from the national spotlight suggest that her chances of securing the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination are slim. With only 2% of Democrats seeing her as an ideal choice, betting on her winning the nomination appears unfavorable.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Although there has been a slight trend towards matches ending under 2.5 goals, December 2025 still shows 55% of matches with over 2.5 goals. Given this context and the recent betting on the \"Over,\" it seems reasonable to predict that the total will exceed 2.5 goals.",
