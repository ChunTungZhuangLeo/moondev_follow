  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a clear betting opportunity on Barcelona due to strong recent form, with most models calculating a 13-16% edge. There is strong agreement that Trump's Gaza Board is unlikely to be established in 2025, though estimates of the true probability vary widely from 25% to 90%. For the West Brom match, opinions are split between \"no trade\" and betting against them, reflecting disagreement on how to weigh Sheffield United's unbeaten streak against home-field advantage.",
