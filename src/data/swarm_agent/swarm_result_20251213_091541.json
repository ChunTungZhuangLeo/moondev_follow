  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting \"NO\" on Markets 1 and 2, as all AIs agree the true probability of these events is far below the market price, though they disagree slightly on the exact estimates. For Market 3, the consensus is to take \"NO_TRADE,\" as the calculated edge for either outcome is either below or too close to the 10% threshold to be a clear recommendation. Overall, the analysis finds high-confidence \"NO\" opportunities in the geopolitical markets but no sufficiently strong edge in the esports match.",
