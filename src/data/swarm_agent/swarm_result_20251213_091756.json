Given the Blackhawks' recent poor performance and the lower scoring nature of their games, betting on the game to stay under 6.5 goals seems reasonable.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Despite Bedard's absence, the Detroit Red Wings have been performing strongly, especially on the road. Their offensive prowess could compensate for the Blackhawks' scoring difficulties, making it plausible for the total to exceed 5.5 goals.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's strong home form combined with Wolfsburg's weaker defense and head-to-head history suggests that the game may have enough goals to surpass the 2.5 mark. The significant recent trade on the Over also indicates market confidence in a higher scoring match.",
