([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/gold-clings-7-week-high-investors-gauge-fed-trajectory-silver-near-record-peak-2025-12-12/?utm_source=openai)) This surge is largely attributed to expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the coming year, leading to a weakening U.S. dollar and increased investor demand for gold.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Investor Activity:** The gold futures market has seen heightened activity, with trading volumes increasing to 305,912 contracts on December 12, up from 245,499 the previous day.

The over/under for the game is set at 245.5 points.\n\n**Recent Team Performances:**\n\n- **Cleveland Cavaliers:** The Cavaliers have struggled recently, losing five of their last seven games. During this stretch, they scored a season-low 94 points against the Golden State Warriors. Head coach Kenny Atkinson has emphasized returning to fundamentals during the team's five-day break. Star player Donovan Mitchell is averaging 30.5 points per game, while Evan Mobley contributes 18.9 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game. Center Jarrett Allen is expected to return after missing five games due to a finger injury.

He secured his seat in the Tongatapu 5 constituency with 72.93% of the vote, the highest polling candidate nationwide. ([matangitonga.to](https://matangitonga.to/2025/11/20/seven-mps-lose-seats-poor-turnout-general-election?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the 2025 general election, voter turnout was notably low, with less than 50% of registered voters casting ballots. Despite this, Dr. Eke's significant margin of victory indicates strong support within his constituency. ([matangitonga.to](https://matangitonga.to/2025/11/20/seven-mps-lose-seats-poor-turnout-general-election?utm_source=openai))\n\nDr. Eke's tenure as Prime Minister began in January 2025, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Hu'akavameiliku. He was officially appointed by King Tupou VI on January 22, 2025, and announced his cabinet on January 28, 2025.

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES  \nReasoning: As of December 12, 2025, gold prices are already above the $4,000 mark, trading at $4,286.35 per ounce. The current trend and positive investor sentiment driven by anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts suggest that gold is likely to remain above $4,000 at the end of 2025.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The Cavaliers have struggled recently, scoring a season-low and having several losses. The return of Jarrett Allen may help defensively, but with the Cavaliers' inconsistent performance and the recent emphasis on fundamentals, it seems less likely they will reach a high-scoring match of over 245.5 points against the Wizards.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Dr. 'Aisake Valu Eke has been re-elected as Prime Minister after the November 2025 election with a significant margin of 72.93% of the vote, indicating strong support. Given this context, he will continue as Prime Minister, making the bet on \"Yes\" favorable.",

Given this proximity to the year-end, it is highly probable it will close above $4000.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: The Cavaliers have recently struggled offensively, scoring a season-low 94 points, and their coach is emphasizing fundamentals, suggesting a potentially lower-scoring game. An over/under of 245.5 points seems high given their recent performance.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: The news explicitly states that Dr. 'Aisake Valu Eke was re-elected in the general election on November 20, 2025, and remains the Prime Minister of Tonga as of December 12, 2025.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: YES\nReasoning: Gold is currently trading at $4,286.35 per ounce as of December 12, 2025, already well above the $4,000 threshold. With expectations of Fed rate cuts supporting gold prices and only about 2.5 weeks until year-end, gold would need to drop over 7% to close below $4,000, which is unlikely given current momentum.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: Despite the Cavaliers' recent struggles, the Wizards have been one of the worst defensive teams in the league, and games involving Washington typically produce high-scoring affairs. With Jarrett Allen returning and Mitchell averaging 30.5 PPG, the offensive firepower should be sufficient to push this game over 245.5.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Dr. 'Aisake Valu Eke has already been re-elected in the November 20, 2025 election with 72.93% of the vote (highest nationwide) and remains Prime Minister as of December 12, 2025.

Without knowing current market odds, the risk/reward is unclear.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The Cavaliers have struggled offensively recently (scoring only 94 points in their last game), while the Wizards are on a losing streak. This suggests potential for a lower-scoring game, but Jarrett Allen's return and the teams' season averages need to be weighed against recent form.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Dr. 'Aisake Valu Eke was already re-elected as Prime Minister following the November 20, 2025 election with a commanding 72.93% victory in his constituency. He is currently serving as PM, making this outcome already determined.",
