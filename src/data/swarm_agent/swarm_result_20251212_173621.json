  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly recommends betting against West Bromwich Albion (Market 1) and in favor of Barcelona (Market 3), citing poor form versus strong streaks as clear edges. Analysts disagree sharply on the Gaza board (Market 2), split between \"NO\" due to a 2026 timeline and \"NO_TRADE\" due to execution ambiguity, though all agree the 96% price is overvalued. Overall, Markets 1 and 3 show actionable edges based on performance data, while Market 2's political uncertainty creates division despite a shared view the current odds are wrong.",

West Brom hasn't beaten Sheffield United in 5 league games since 2021. The market at 60% for a WBA win is massively mispriced given current form and head-to-head record.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump establish a Gaza \"Board of Peace\" in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 88%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -8%\nExpected Value: Not sufficient\nReasoning: Trump announced the Board of Peace on Dec 10, 2025, but specifically stated members would be announced \"early next year.\" The market question is about establishing it in 2025 - with only ~19 days left and Trump saying announcements come in 2026, there's ambiguity about what \"establish\" means. However, the announcement itself may count as establishment, making this close to 96%.

However, Olympiacos is a top EuroLeague team that just added Monte Morris. This is essentially a coin flip between two quality teams, with slight home advantage for Barcelona. Market pricing seems accurate at ~54%.",

WBA also winless in last 5 H2H meetings. Home advantage provides some value, but 35% true probability suggests market significantly overvalues WBA. However, the -25% edge favors NO side, not meeting our 10% threshold for a recommended trade.\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 96%\nEdge: -81% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: High positive EV on NO side (81% \u00d7 payout ratio)\nReasoning: Trump announced the board would be named \"early next year\" (2026), not established in 2025. The market appears to confuse announcement with establishment. Even if expedited, creating an international governance board with \"kings, presidents, and prime ministers\" requires months of negotiation, legal framework, and implementation - virtually impossible to complete in the remaining 19 days of 2025. This is severe mispricing.\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 54.3%\nEdge: +13.7% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate positive EV (13.7% \u00d7 payout ratio)\nReasoning: Barcelona has won 7 of their last 8 games under new coach Xavi Pascual, showing dramatic improvement. Playing at home (Palau Blaugrana) provides significant advantage in EuroLeague basketball. While Olympiacos added Monte Morris, Barcelona's recent form and home court advantage suggest 65-70% true win probability. Market undervalues Barcelona's momentum and home advantage by approximately 14%.",
