In their most recent game, they suffered a 123-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors, marking their worst offensive performance of the season. Coach Billy Donovan emphasized the need for improved team effort and attention to detail.

([wargamer.com](https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/kabuto-king-first-edition-collection-prices?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis surge has been accompanied by notable sales, including four PSA 10 graded copies selling for prices ranging from $1,025 to $1,225. ([sports.yahoo.com](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/kabuto-king-looks-corner-market-203000007.html/?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, Kabuto King auctioned a signed card for charity, which sold for $51,100, with proceeds benefiting St. Jude\u2019s Children's Research Hospital.

However, recent developments provide context for this potential policy action:\n\n**Recent Federal Reserve Actions and Projections:**\n\n- **December 2025 Rate Cut:** On December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the federal funds rate by 25 bps, bringing it to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. This decision followed similar cuts in September and October 2025. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rates-decision?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Future Projections:** The FOMC's projections indicate a cautious approach to future rate adjustments. While some market participants anticipate additional cuts in 2026, the Fed's projections suggest only one more 25 bps cut in 2026, maintaining a neutral policy stance.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that the Kabuto card market offers a significant edge, with most models recommending a \"YES\" bet due to the collector-driven momentum. For the Bulls vs. Hornets game, opinions are split between \"NO\" and \"NO_TRADE,\" indicating the market price is seen as roughly efficient or slightly favoring the Hornets. Regarding the Fed decision, models generally view the current 81% probability as too high, recommending a \"NO\" bet or no trade due to the Fed's projected cautious pace.",

The \"Kabuto King\" has already driven prices significantly and market manipulation schemes typically face diminishing returns.

Hornets at home have slight edge, but this is essentially a coin flip between two poor teams. Market price is approximately fair.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 40%\nEdge: -15% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +15% on NO side\nReasoning: Card went from $2.50 to $38 (15x increase) in 4 months due to one collector's manipulation. Reaching $100 requires another 2.6x increase in just 19 days - an unsustainable pace even with artificial demand. PSA 10 graded copies at $1,200 show ceiling, but raw cards need 160% gain in 2.5 weeks.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: Bet NO** - Market significantly overvalues the probability of this manipulated price reaching $100 by year-end.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 81%\nEdge: -66% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +66% on NO side\nReasoning: Fed just cut 25 bps on December 10, 2025, and their own projections indicate only ONE more 25 bps cut for ALL of 2026. With inflation concerns and cautious stance, a January cut (just 6 weeks after December cut) is highly unlikely. Market is severely mispricing this - Fed typically spaces cuts apart and has signaled slower pace.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: STRONG BET NO** - This is the strongest edge of the three markets. The Fed's own guidance contradicts an 81% probability of a January cut.",
