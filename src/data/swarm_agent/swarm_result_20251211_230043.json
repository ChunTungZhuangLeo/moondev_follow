  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Market 1 due to Frankfurt's poor form and injuries, while most analysts decline to trade on Market 2 due to ambiguous or irrelevant sports context.

Overall, the only clear agreement is against Frankfurt winning, with other markets seen as either lacking information or being too close to call.",

The past performances in different sports don't provide enough relevant insight into the upcoming matchup.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: The recent high-scoring performances of both teams, with the Hurricanes winning 4-1 and the Capitals consistently earning points, suggest that the over/under of 5.5 goals is likely to be exceeded, supported by the recent trade activity favoring the Over.",

Despite playing at home, their current struggles make a win uncertain.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The news context only covers football and women's basketball matchups, not the men's basketball game this market appears to reference. Without specific information on the men's teams' current form and rosters, I cannot make an informed prediction.\n\nMARKET 3: Over\nReasoning: While both teams have shown strong defensive play recently (Capitals with a shutout, Hurricanes winning 4-1), the Capitals' high-scoring offense combined with Carolina's solid attack typically produces action. However, both teams' recent low-scoring games against Columbus suggest this could stay under 5.5.\n\nWait, let me reconsider Market 3:\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Recent games show both teams playing defensively strong hockey - Capitals had a 2-0 shutout and Hurricanes won 4-1. The trend toward lower-scoring games makes this a coin flip at 5.5, not worth the risk.",

The odds are unclear without seeing the market prices, making this too risky to call confidently.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: The context shows Iowa State winning in football (16-13) and women's basketball (74-69), but this market appears to be about men's basketball on 2025-12-11, for which no specific preview or recent form data was provided. Cannot make an informed prediction without knowing which sport or relevant team statistics.\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nReasoning: Both teams have strong offensive capabilities, and the Capitals are on a hot streak (10-1-1 in last 12). However, Washington just had a 2-0 shutout, suggesting defensive strength. The recent $1,475 bet on Over indicates sharp money agrees, and Carolina scored 4 in their last game, supporting an Over 5.5 total.",
