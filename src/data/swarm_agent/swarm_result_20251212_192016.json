Given the complex geopolitical dynamics and the lack of a clear imminent threat, taking a position is risky.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: The market indicates a 93% chance of resolving to \"No,\" suggesting high confidence that at least one of the listed world leaders will be out of power by December 31, 2025. Given the political volatility in several of these countries, this high probability is reasonable, making a \"No\" position favorable.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Both teams have shown tendencies towards high-scoring matches, with Real Sociedad averaging 1.27 goals scored and 1.47 conceded per match, and Girona FC averaging 0.87 goals scored and 1.93 conceded per match. This suggests a strong likelihood of the match exceeding 1.5 total goals.",

Political transitions rarely happen this quickly without warning signs.\n\nMARKET 3: YES (Over 1.5)\nReasoning: Both teams' statistics support over 1.5 goals - Real Sociedad averages 2.74 total goals per match and Girona's matches average 2.8 goals. With Girona conceding nearly 2 goals per game and Real Sociedad scoring 1.27 per match at home, exceeding 1.5 total goals is highly probable.",

No imminent threats to any of these leaders have emerged in recent news, making \"nothing happens\" the overwhelmingly likely outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Real Sociedad averages 1.27 goals/match and Girona 0.87 goals/match, suggesting combined average around 2.1 goals.
