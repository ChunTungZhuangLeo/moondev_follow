      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: The historical context shows that \u00c7aykur Rizespor has dominated the recent encounters against Ey\u00fcpspor, but both teams have shown inconsistent performances in their recent matches. With both teams having a mix of wins, losses, and draws, the outcome is uncertain. Hence, a no trade is the prudent choice given the information.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: C\u00f3rdoba CF is on a poor run, failing to win any of their last five matches. Although Eibar is also underperforming, the significant recent trading volume on \"No\" suggests market sentiment strongly believes C\u00f3rdoba CF will not win. Given their current form, betting against C\u00f3rdoba CF seems the more likely outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Arsenal, despite being favorites, recently lost to Aston Villa and has injury concerns, including key player Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es being out. Wolverhampton Wanderers could potentially keep the game close given Arsenal's mixed recent performances, making it less likely for Arsenal to cover a -1.5 spread.",
