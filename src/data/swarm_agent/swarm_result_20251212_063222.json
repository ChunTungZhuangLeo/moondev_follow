This figure is consistent with the turnout in the previous general election, suggesting stability in voter participation.\n\nThe election process has been marked by significant challenges, including technical issues with the vote-counting system and allegations of fraud. These complications have led to delays in finalizing the results. Despite these obstacles, the National Electoral Council (CNE) has committed to ensuring transparency and accuracy in the announcement of results, reflecting the will of the people as expressed during the election.

This is historical fact, not prediction.
