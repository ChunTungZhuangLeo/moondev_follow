([thescore.com](https://www.thescore.com/fran/events/89963?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recent Form:**\n\n- **Angers SCO:** The team has shown strong home performance, securing three wins in their last four home matches. ([insights.betfred.com](https://insights.betfred.com/football/ligue-1/angers-sco-vs-nantes-prediction-betting-tips-odds-friday-12-december-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **FC Nantes:** Nantes is struggling, having lost their last three matches and failing to secure a victory in their last five. ([futbol24.com](https://www.futbol24.com/betting-tips/preview/12-12-2025-angers-sco-fc-nantes-betting-tip/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Match Predictions:**\n\n- Betfred's analysis suggests a competitive match, with Angers favored to win, given their recent form and home advantage.

([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/paradex-fdv-above-3b-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai)) This reflects a consensus among traders that the token's valuation is unlikely to surpass this threshold shortly after its debut.\n\nIn contrast, other prediction markets for different tokens show higher probabilities for exceeding similar FDV thresholds. For instance, the MegaETH token's FDV has a 40.0% chance of surpassing $3 billion one day after launch. ([monitor.polymarketspro.com](https://monitor.polymarketspro.com/market/megaeth-market-cap-fdv-2b-one-day-after-launch-392?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, the Backpack token's FDV has a 65.5% probability of exceeding $1 billion one day after launch.

However, recent developments and expert analyses provide insight into the potential trajectory of his political career:\n\n- **Speculation on 2028 Candidacy**: Political analysts have noted that Rubio's recent activities, including increased public appearances and policy advocacy, suggest he may be positioning himself for a future presidential run. His focus on key issues such as national security and economic reform aligns with the priorities of the Republican base.\n\n- **Public Opinion Polls**: Recent polls indicate that Rubio maintains a favorable standing among Republican voters, with approval ratings comparable to other potential 2028 contenders. However, these polls are preliminary and may not fully capture the dynamics of the upcoming election cycle.\n\n- **Expert Opinions**: Political commentators highlight Rubio's experience as a fo\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions in the exact format specified.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows strong agreement that Market 1's \"Yes\" has a moderate edge due to Angers' home form, with most AIs estimating a 60-70% true probability versus the 55% market price. For Market 2, there is notable disagreement on the true probability (estimates range from 8% to 45%), but all agree the 49.9% market price is severely overvalued, making \"No\" the clear trade. Regarding Market 3, all AIs unanimously view the 95.9% price for Rubio as a massive overestimate, recommending a \"No\" bet due to the extreme edge against it.",

The edge isn't sufficient to recommend a NO bet despite slight overpricing.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Lighter FDV >$3B one day after launch**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 15%\nMarket Price: 49.9%\nEdge: -34.9% (15% - 49.9%)\nExpected Value: 34.9% \u00d7 1.00 = 34.9%\nReasoning: The web search explicitly states Polymarket shows only 7.3% probability for this outcome, yet the market displays 49.9%. This appears to be a massive discrepancy - either stale pricing or market manipulation. Very few token launches achieve $3B+ FDV immediately; this is an extremely high bar that even hyped projects rarely clear.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Marco Rubio win 2028 Presidential Election**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 8%\nMarket Price: 95.9%\nEdge: -87.9% (8% - 95.9%)\nExpected Value: 87.9% \u00d7 0.04 = 3.5%\nReasoning: This price makes no sense - Rubio hasn't even declared candidacy, and winning a presidential election requires surviving primaries against multiple candidates, then winning the general.
