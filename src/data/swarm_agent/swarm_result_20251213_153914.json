This collective includes Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, along with other prominent figures such as Sam Altman of OpenAI, Elon Musk of xAI, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Lisa Su of AMD, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, Dario Amodei of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li of Stanford University. ([time.com](https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/?utm_source=openai))\n\nJensen Huang's inclusion in this group highlights his pivotal role in advancing AI technology. Under his leadership, Nvidia has become a dominant force in AI hardware, supplying the processors that power many of today's AI models. Huang's vision for AI extends beyond technology, emphasizing its potential to reshape global economics and society.

Kast, representing the Republican Party, has gained significant momentum following the first-round election results on November 16, 2025, where he secured approximately 23% of the vote, trailing Jara by about 3 percentage points.

He has also engaged in diplomatic discussions with Argentine President Javier Milei and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a, aiming to strengthen international ties.

The prediction market \"Ink FDV above $500M one day after launch?\" on Polymarket, created on October 16, 2025, remains unresolved, with a deadline of January 1, 2027. ([polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com/event/ink-fdv-above-one-day-after-launch?utm_source=openai)) The market has generated $159,494 in volume, with 86% of participants betting on a \"Yes\" outcome. However, without an official launch, the market cannot resolve.\n\nIn the broader context of prediction markets, similar events have been analyzed. For instance, the \"Felix Protocol FDV above $500M one day after launch?\" market on Polymarket is currently trading at 3.1%, reflecting low confidence among traders.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no actionable trades with a 10%+ edge, as all models agree Market 1 is fairly priced and Markets 2 & 3 are overvalued. There is strong agreement that Markets 2 and 3 present significant negative edges, making \"NO\" positions the clear, aligned recommendation against their current prices. The only minor discrepancy is in the exact probability estimates for each market, but this does not change the unified trading conclusions.",
