For instance, the \"420-439\" tweets outcome has a probability of 10.2%, while the \"400-419\" outcome stands at 10.5%.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus shows no trade for Market 1 due to insufficient edge despite Tundra's better form, while Markets 2 and 3 are widely seen as mispriced with strong recommendations to bet \"NO.\" Analysts unanimously agree the 89.5% price for Market 2 is a severe data error, creating a massive edge against that outcome. For Market 3, all agree the implied probability is vastly overstated compared to the actual box office data, making \"NO\" a high-value trade.",

However, given Aurora's recent win against Tundra, the current market price already reflects a strong likelihood of Tundra's victory, making the edge insufficient for a trade recommendation.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nYour Probability: 75%  \nMarket Price: 89.5%  \nEdge: -14.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -14.5% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: There is no specific information indicating a surge in Musk's tweeting activity, and the high market price suggests overconfidence in a narrow tweet range. Given the variability of his tweeting habits, the probability seems overstated.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 2%  \nMarket Price: 97.5%  \nEdge: -95.5% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -95.5% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite \"A Minecraft Movie\" performing well, it is far behind \"Ne Zha 2\" in box office earnings.

The 78% market price fairly reflects Tundra's advantage with some uncertainty from the previous loss.\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 89.5%\nEdge: -84.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: This market asks if Elon will post 420-439 tweets (YES), but context shows that outcome has only 10.2% probability. The 89.5% price appears to be for NO (not hitting this specific range), making NO the correct bet with massive edge.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO - The market is pricing YES at 89.5% when the actual probability of hitting exactly 420-439 tweets is around 10%. This is a 79.5% edge on the NO side.**\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 97.5%\nEdge: -52.5% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive on NO side\nReasoning: Minecraft Movie has grossed $958M but China's \"Ne Zha 2\" already earned $1.9 billion - nearly double. With only weeks left in 2025, Minecraft cannot catch up. Market severely overpricing YES.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: BET NO - Ne Zha 2's $1.9B vs Minecraft's $958M makes this outcome nearly impossible.
