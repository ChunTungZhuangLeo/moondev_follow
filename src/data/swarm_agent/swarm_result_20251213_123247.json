  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong agreement on Market 2, recommending a \"YES\" trade on the Capitals due to a consistent ~14% edge from their superior form. For Markets 1 and 3, analysts generally agree the current prices are overvalued, though they disagree on the severity, leading to mixed \"NO\" or \"NO_TRADE\" recommendations. The only actionable trade with a 10%+ edge is buying \"YES\" on the Capitals vs. Jets.",
