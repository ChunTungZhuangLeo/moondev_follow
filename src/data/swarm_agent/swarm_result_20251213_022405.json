  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies Market 1's 97.7% price as a severe mispricing or data error, with all AIs estimating a true probability below 10% and thus a massive edge on \"NO.\" For Market 2, most AIs agree there is a positive edge on \"YES,\" though the estimated edge magnitude varies from +11% to +19%. There is no strong consensus on a recommended trade for Market 3, as the estimated edges are minimal or negative.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nYour Probability: 5%\nMarket Price: 97.7%\nEdge: -92.7% (5% - 97.7%)\nExpected Value: Extremely high on NO side\nReasoning: The market price of 97.7% appears to be an error or illiquid market anomaly. The news clearly states Kalshi's market implied only a 5% chance for Beshear, he hasn't declared candidacy, and there are numerous other potential Democratic candidates for 2028. This is a massive mispricing.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 42%\nMarket Price: 41.0%\nEdge: +1% (42% - 41%)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Real Zaragoza is in good form (unbeaten in 5) playing at home against struggling C\u00e1diz (lost 4 of 5), but they have significant injuries and suspensions. The 41% market price seems roughly fair given home advantage offset by squad issues. Head-to-head shows competitive matches historically.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 30%\nMarket Price: 33.0%\nEdge: -3% (30% - 33%)\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: With Zaragoza's recent draw against M\u00e1laga and the head-to-head showing 3 draws in 5 meetings, a draw is plausible. However, Zaragoza's home advantage and C\u00e1diz's poor form suggest a decisive result is slightly more likely than the market implies. The edge is insufficient for a trade.",

This is likely showing the wrong side (NO at 97.7% = YES at 2.3%). If the actual YES price is 2-5%, that would align with fundamentals for a governor who hasn't declared and faces a crowded field.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: YES\nYour Probability: 52%\nMarket Price: 41.0%\nEdge: +11% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.19 units per dollar (11% edge \u00d7 1.73 payout)\nReasoning: Zaragoza is home, unbeaten in 5 matches (3W-2D), while C\u00e1diz lost 4 of last 5 away games. Home advantage plus current form disparity suggests Zaragoza should be slight favorites. The 41% price undervalues their winning chances given the momentum differential and venue advantage.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 23%\nMarket Price: 33.0%\nEdge: -10% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: +0.20 units per dollar (10% edge on NO side)\nReasoning: With Zaragoza's strong home form (only 2 draws in last 5) and C\u00e1diz's defensive struggles (conceding in most matches), a decisive result is more likely than the 33% draw probability suggests. LaLiga 2 draws occur ~25% of the time, and these teams' recent form patterns favor a winner emerging.",
