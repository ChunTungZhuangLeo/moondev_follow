Time has named the \"Architects of AI\" as its 2025 Person of the Year, highlighting figures like Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, for their significant contributions to artificial intelligence. ([time.com](https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the aftermath of Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025, there have been efforts to honor his legacy. On December 10, 2025, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced a bill to rename Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., to \"Charlie Kirk Freedom of Speech Plaza.\" However, the bill's prospects are uncertain, especially in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Despite efforts to honor Kirk posthumously, the lack of official confirmation makes it unlikely he will be on the shortlist.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: MOUZ is favored to win Map 1 against FaZe, with odds indicating a slight advantage for MOUZ.
