([yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mariah-carey-want-christmas-hits-142257737.html?utm_source=openai)) This trend reflects a 120% increase in global streams over the past five years. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/13/mariah-carey-christmas-most-streamed-holiday-song?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn 2025, Bad Bunny reclaimed the title of Spotify's most-streamed artist globally, surpassing Taylor Swift, who had held the top spot in 2023 and 2024. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fb021e2387d6aff7e4d8353a067f1664?utm_source=openai)) However, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has maintained its position as the most-streamed holiday song, topping Spotify's global charts every Christmas Day since 2016.

Without more current polling or election results, it's difficult to predict the outcome confidently.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nReasoning: \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey has consistently topped Spotify's charts every Christmas Day for several consecutive years and continues to set streaming records. This strong historical trend suggests it will likely be the top song again on December 25.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: The recent trade heavily favors the Army Black Knights, and considering UMBC's mixed performance, including a significant loss to Georgetown, they may struggle to cover a -7.5 spread.

However, with elections not until 2026 and Orb\u00e1n's entrenched position, this is a longer-term bet with significant uncertainty, but Magyar appears the most likely opposition candidate to succeed.\n\nMARKET 2: YES\nReasoning: \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has topped Spotify's global charts every Christmas Day since 2016 and set a new streaming record in 2024 with 24.86 million streams. This is an extremely strong historical pattern that makes YES highly probable.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: UMBC is 6-4 with inconsistent performances (blowout loss to Georgetown 86-62, but solid win over Delaware State). Covering a 7.5-point spread requires a dominant performance, and their recent volatility against varying competition levels suggests Army could keep this within the spread.",

The consistent historical pattern and accelerating growth (120% increase over five years) makes this highly predictable for December 25.\n\nMARKET 3: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: This appears to be a college basketball spread bet for a game that has already occurred (December 12, 2025 date appears to be an error, likely meant 2024).
