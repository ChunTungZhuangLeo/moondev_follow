Without specific insights into the teams' form or recent performances in CS2, it is difficult to make an informed prediction on the Over/Under 2.5 games market.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE  \nReasoning: Both Heroic and Pipsqueak+4 have similar recent performance records, with each winning 6 out of their last 10 matches. Although Heroic is ranked higher, the recent defeat to MOUZ suggests some vulnerability. The match seems evenly matched, making it challenging to confidently predict an outcome.\n\nMARKET 3: YES  \nReasoning: Bayern Munich is in exceptional form, leading the Bundesliga with a significant goal difference and a recent impressive comeback victory against Sporting Lisbon. Mainz 05, on the other hand, is struggling at the bottom of the league. Given Bayern's current performance, betting on them to win seems highly favorable.",
