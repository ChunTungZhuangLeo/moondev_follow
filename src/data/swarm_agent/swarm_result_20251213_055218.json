  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies no clear trade for Market 1, as all models see the 97% price as too high but disagree on the true probability. For Market 2, two models recommend a \"YES\" trade on the Oilers, citing a performance edge, while others see no opportunity. All models strongly agree on a \"NO\" position for Market 3, judging the 97.1% price as vastly overstating the probability of military capture.",
