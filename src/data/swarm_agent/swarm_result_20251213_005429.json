Even as favorites, winning consecutive playoff matches has significant variance. A 78.6% probability implies they're ~89% favorites in each remaining match, which is too high.

The market price shown (97%) appears to be an error or stale. Tripling daily revenue from $100k to $300k in remaining ~18 days of 2025 is extremely unlikely without a massive catalyst. Strong NO.",
