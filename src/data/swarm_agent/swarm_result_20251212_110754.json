In January 2024, he suspended his campaign for the 2024 election and endorsed former President Donald Trump. ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ron-desantis-drops-out-2024-republican-presidential-race/?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent polls indicate that DeSantis is not currently a leading contender for the 2028 nomination. A June 2025 Emerson College Polling survey showed Vice President J.D. Vance leading with 46% support, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at 12%, and DeSantis at 9%. ([iheart.com](https://www.iheart.com/content/2025-06-27-overwhelming-favorite-leads-2028-republican-nomination-poll/?utm_source=openai)) Similarly, a September 2025 YouGov survey found DeSantis with 7% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, trailing Vance at 53% and Donald Trump Jr. at 10%.

The Democratic plan aimed to extend the subsidies for three years, while the Republican plan proposed health savings accounts as alternatives. Neither proposal garnered the necessary 60 votes to advance, leading to concerns about rising healthcare costs for millions of Americans. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/11/senate-aca-subsidies-vote-obamacare?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf these enhanced tax credits expire, premiums for subsidized enrollees are projected to increase by 114% in 2026, significantly impacting both lower and higher-income individuals. Approximately one in four ACA users may drop coverage due to increased costs. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e143b36cc01b4d7f27a1c07e17d1583c?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn response to the Senate's inaction, bipartisan grou...\n\n---\n\n\nProvide predictions for each market in the specified format.",

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for Markets 2 and 3, with unanimous agreement on DeSantis's low polling and the Senate's recent rejection of ACA credit extensions. For Market 1, most AIs favor Team Spirit, though two advise \"NO_TRADE\" due to the large recent wager on Liquid, indicating a minor disagreement on betting certainty. Overall, the collective analysis finds the clearest, most data-supported predictions against DeSantis's nomination and the ACA measure's passage.",

      "response": "MARKET 1: NO\nReasoning: Team Spirit is currently ranked higher and has a better recent performance record than Team Liquid, winning 4 of their last 5 matches compared to Team Liquid's 3. Additionally, Team Spirit leads the head-to-head record. Despite recent trades favoring Team Liquid, the performance metrics suggest Team Spirit is more likely to win.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Ron DeSantis is not a leading contender for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination, as indicated by recent polls where he trails significantly behind J.D. Vance and others. Additionally, he has not announced his candidacy, making it unlikely for him to win the nomination.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Given the recent rejection of both Democratic and Republican proposals to extend ACA premium tax credits, it appears unlikely that these credits will be extended. Coupled with the Democrats' current struggle to advance their agenda and the uncertainty of the 2026 House elections, it seems improbable that both the credits will be extended and the Democrats will win the House.",

The stronger recent form and historical advantage favor Team Spirit.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: DeSantis polling at only 7-9% while JD Vance dominates at 46-53% makes his path to the nomination extremely difficult. His failed 2024 campaign and lack of announced candidacy further diminish his prospects.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: This requires BOTH conditions to be met. The Senate just rejected ACA premium credit extensions with neither party's proposal advancing, making extension unlikely. Additionally, Democrats winning the House in 2026 is uncertain. The probability of both occurring is very low.",

Vance, and he has not announced a candidacy.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Senate has already failed to pass an extension of the ACA credits, and with their expiration imminent, the first condition of the market is highly unlikely to be met regardless of the 2026 House outcome.",

However, the recent $700 trade on Liquid suggests market movement, and without seeing current odds, it's difficult to assess if there's value either way.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: DeSantis polls at only 7-9% for 2028, trailing far behind J.D. Vance (46-53%) and even Marco Rubio. His 2024 campaign suspension and current low polling numbers suggest he's not positioned as a frontrunner for the 2028 nomination.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: The Senate just rejected both Democratic and Republican proposals to extend ACA credits as of December 11, 2025, with neither reaching the 60-vote threshold. This makes extension unlikely in the near term, and even if credits were extended, Democrats winning the House in 2026 (the second condition) adds another layer of uncertainty.",
