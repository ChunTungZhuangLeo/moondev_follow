The most recent incident occurred on December 10, when Ukrainian sea drones disabled the Dashan tanker, part of Russia's \"shadow fleet,\" in Ukraine's exclusive economic zone. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-disables-shadow-fleet-vessel-with-sea-drones-black-sea-2025-12-10/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has intensified its attacks on Russian oil infrastructure in the Black Sea. On November 29, Ukrainian naval drones struck two sanctioned tankers, the Kairos and the Virat, as they were en route to a Russian port to load oil destined for foreign markets. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/29/ukrainian-naval-drones-strike-two-russian-oil-tankers-in-black-sea?utm_source=openai)) These attacks are part of Ukraine's broader strategy to disrupt Russia's oil exports and reduce its war funding.\n\nThe use of sea drones has ...\n\n---\n\nMarket 2:\nTitle: Will Thailand capture Preah Vihear temple by Dec 31?\nRecent trade: $886.42 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/will-thailand-capture-preah-vihear-temple-by-dec-31\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 13, 2025, the situation regarding Thailand's potential capture of the Preah Vihear Temple by December 31 remains uncertain. Recent developments indicate ongoing tensions and military actions between Thailand and Cambodia, particularly around the temple area.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Military Clashes:** On December 7, 2025, Thai forces initiated an attack in the Prolean Thmor area of Cambodia's Preah Vihear Province, using small arms, grenade launchers, and mortars. Cambodia responded by contacting Thai counterparts to cease fire, maintaining restraint without returning fire. The shooting ceased by 2:32 p.m. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cambodia%E2%80%92Thailand_conflict?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Damage to Cultural Heritage:** Cambodia's Ministry of Culture condemned Thai military actions on December 8, 2025, which resulted in damage to the Gopura V Conservation and Restoration Project and other conservation infrastructure near the Preah Vih...\n\n---\n\nMarket 3:\nTitle: Will Giannis Antetokounmpo be traded to the Toronto Raptors?\nRecent trade: $898.07 on No\nLink: https://polymarket.com/event/where-will-giannis-be-traded\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 RECENT NEWS/CONTEXT FROM WEB SEARCH:\nAs of December 13, 2025, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Giannis Antetokounmpo is being traded to the Toronto Raptors. In October 2023, Antetokounmpo signed a three-year, $186 million contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks, keeping him under contract through the 2027-28 season. ([nba.com](https://www.nba.com/news/bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-extension?utm_source=openai))\n\nHowever, recent developments indicate potential changes. In early December 2025, reports emerged that Antetokounmpo and the Bucks are discussing his future, including the possibility of a trade before the February 1 trade deadline. The Bucks are currently underperforming, with a 9-13 record following a seven-game losing streak. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sports/report-giannis-antetokounmpo-bucks-discussing-future--flm-2025-12-03/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDespite these discussions, there is no official announcement regarding a trade involving Antetokounmpo.

  "consensus_summary": "The consensus strongly predicts \"NO\" for all three markets, with unanimous agreement on Thailand not capturing the temple and Giannis not being traded to Toronto. For the Ukraine tanker market, there is a notable split, as three AIs predict \"YES\" while three predict \"NO\" or advise against trading, reflecting uncertainty over the short timeframe. Overall, the analysis shows high confidence in two predictions based on a lack of specific evidence, while the third remains contested due to conflicting interpretations of recent attack patterns.",

With the deadline of December 19 approaching and no new incidents reported, it seems unlikely that another strike will occur in this short timeframe.\n\nMARKET 2: NO  \nReasoning: Although there have been recent military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, there is no clear indication that Thailand will capture the Preah Vihear temple by December 31. The conflict seems to be ongoing without a decisive change in control, making a capture by the deadline unlikely.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nReasoning: Despite discussions about Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks, he recently signed a contract extension, and there is no substantial evidence or official reports indicating a trade to the Toronto Raptors. The current market sentiment leans heavily towards no trade happening.",

Thailand has engaged in limited skirmishes but shows no indication of attempting a full capture within 18 days.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: There is no substantial evidence linking Giannis to the Raptors specifically.

Recent large bet on No suggests informed traders see low probability.\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nReasoning: Despite recent border clashes on December 7, there is no credible indication Thailand intends to capture the temple within 18 days. Cambodia maintained restraint and diplomatic channels remain open. A full military capture of this UNESCO site would trigger massive international response and is extremely unlikely in this timeframe.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: While Giannis and the Bucks are discussing his future amid poor performance, there's no specific reporting linking him to Toronto, and the Raptors haven't been mentioned as a destination. The market asks specifically about Toronto, not whether he'll be traded generally, making this highly unlikely without any concrete rumors.",
