  "consensus_summary": "The consensus identifies a strong disagreement on Market 1, with most AIs finding the 95.8% price vastly overvalued versus the reported viewership drop, though they differ on the precise true probability. For Markets 2 and 3, opinions are mixed, resulting in no clear, high-conviction trade meeting the 10% edge threshold across the majority of analyses. Overall, while potential edges exist, the lack of unified high-confidence signals suggests a cautious approach.",

(December 16, 2025)**\n\nMARKET 1: YES\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 95.8%\nEdge: -10.8%\nExpected Value: Negative on YES side\nReasoning: The 60% viewership decline in week 2 is concerning, and the search context mentions only a \"14% chance\" in prediction markets (though this seems to be truncated data). However, even with the decline, 23.6M views is still massive, and no competing show appears strong enough to overtake it. The market at 95.8% may be slightly overpriced given the steep decline trajectory, but not enough for a confident NO bet.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Edge is borderline and uncertainty is high about what \"this week\" Dec 16 actually captures)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen win on 2025-12-13?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 68%\nMarket Price: 62.0%\nEdge: +6%\nExpected Value: ~+6% \u00d7 0.61 = +3.7%\nReasoning: Leverkusen at home against K\u00f6ln (a historically weaker opponent) should be strong favorites despite their recent 2-0 loss to Augsburg. The head-to-head record favors Leverkusen, and home advantage is significant. However, their recent domestic form is shaky. My estimate of ~68% is slightly higher than market but insufficient edge.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Only +6% edge, below threshold)\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Partizan vs. KK Crvena Zvezda**\n\nMARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 72%\nMarket Price: 74.0%\nEdge: -2%\nExpected Value: Minimal\nReasoning: Crvena Zvezda has dominated recent matchups (winning EuroLeague encounter 73-71, Cup Final 89-83 OT). They appear to be the stronger team currently. The 74% market price for Zvezda seems roughly accurate given their recent head-to-head dominance, though Partizan did win one OT game in April.\n\n**Decision: NO_TRADE** (Edge is only ~2%, well below threshold)",
