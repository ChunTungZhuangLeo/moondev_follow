This aligns with historical averages for December, which typically see daytime maximum temperatures around 8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F). ([weather2travel.com](https://www.weather2travel.com/england/london/december/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the Polymarket prediction market for this date, the highest temperature of 11\u00b0C (52\u00b0F) has a 42% chance, and 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) has a 41% chance, indicating a consensus around temperatures slightly above the historical average.

In Volume 1, Jim Hopper survives the initial dangers, including a near-fatal gunshot wound, thanks to Eleven's intervention. However, he faces significant threats, notably when he contemplates sacrificing himself to eliminate Eleven's \"kryptonite,\" later revealed to be her sister, Kali (Eight). ([thedirect.com](https://thedirect.com/article/stranger-things-season-5-who-dies-characters-volume-1?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe Duffer Brothers, creators of the series, have hinted at a major death in Season 5, describing it as \"the most violent death\" in the show's history. While they haven't specified which character will die, this has heightened speculation about the fates of main characters, including Hopper.

Additionally, the Polymarket consensus shows higher probabilities for temperatures above 9\u00b0C, suggesting it's unlikely that 9\u00b0C will be the highest temperature.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nReasoning: Both teams have similar recent performance records, each with two wins and three losses, and they are relatively close in rankings (#10 and #16). The historical dominance of Team Tidebound is not clearly stated, and without clear evidence of a significant advantage, this market is too uncertain to take a position.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nReasoning: Although there is speculation about a major character death, Jim Hopper's survival in Volume 1 and the narrative focus on his potential sacrifice suggest he may survive the season. The recent trade leaning towards \"No\" and the lack of specific hints about his death further support this prediction.",
