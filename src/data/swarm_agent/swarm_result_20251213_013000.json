      "response": "MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 88%\nMarket Price: 91%\nEdge: -3% (88% - 91%)\nExpected Value: Low negative\nReasoning: With 18 days remaining until December 31, 2025, most of these leaders are firmly entrenched. The highest risk is Netanyahu (coalition pressures, legal issues) and Khamenei (age 85, health concerns), but even these are unlikely to change in under 3 weeks. The 91% price seems roughly fair, perhaps slightly optimistic but not enough edge to trade.\n\nMARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 85%\nMarket Price: 89%\nEdge: -4% (85% - 89%)\nExpected Value: Insufficient\nReasoning: The Over 233.5 line is reasonable given Memphis's recent offensive output and pace. However, Jazz are a poor offensive team and if Morant plays, Memphis may control tempo more deliberately. The market at 89% for Over seems slightly high but within reasonable range - not enough edge to justify a NO bet.\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 35%\nMarket Price: 56%\nEdge: -21% (35% - 56%)\nExpected Value: +21% \u00d7 ~0.79 = ~16.6% expected return\nReasoning: This appears to be pricing Grizzlies at 56% to win the first half, which is reasonable given they're 6.5-point favorites at home with Morant potentially returning. However, the market title says \"Jazz vs. Grizzlies: 1H Moneyline\" which typically means the first-listed team (Jazz). If this is pricing Jazz at 56% to win 1H, that's severely mispriced - the Jazz are significant underdogs on the road against a hot Memphis team. Strong NO on Jazz winning the first half.",

      "response": "# Polymarket Market Analysis\n\n## MARKET 1: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 88%\n**Market Price:** 91%\n**Edge:** -3% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Negative\n**Reasoning:** With 18 days remaining until Dec 31, 2025, the risk of a major leader departure exists but is low. Netanyahu faces coalition instability and potential ICC warrant issues, while Iran's Khamenei (86 years old) poses health risks. However, sudden regime changes are rare in such short timeframes. Market price is approximately fair.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\n**Your Probability:** 85%\n**Market Price:** 89%\n**Edge:** -4% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Negative\n**Reasoning:** Both teams play at fast pace, and the 233.5 line is reasonable. Grizzlies averaging high scoring without Morant, but his questionable status adds uncertainty. Jazz rookies developing but inconsistent. The 89% Over price seems slightly high given Morant's injury uncertainty, but not enough edge to warrant a NO bet.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\n**Your Probability:** 68%\n**Market Price:** 56%\n**Edge:** +12% (Your prob - Market)\n**Expected Value:** Strong positive (+12% \u00d7 ~0.79 payout = ~9.5% EV)\n**Reasoning:** The 56% market price for Grizzlies 1H moneyline is undervalued. Memphis has won 7 of last 9 games and plays at home where they're typically dominant in first halves. Even without Morant, they've been winning, and if he returns (questionable status), that's additional upside. Jazz are road underdogs with developing rookies. Grizzlies should be 65-70% favorites for the first half at home.",
