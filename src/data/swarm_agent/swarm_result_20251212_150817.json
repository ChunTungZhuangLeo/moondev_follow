Despite initial claims of strong demand, recent developments indicate a substantial shortfall in sales.\n\n**Program Overview:**\nThe \"Trump Gold Card\" program was launched to offer wealthy foreign nationals expedited U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment. The initiative aimed to replace the existing EB-5 visa program, which required investments tied to job creation. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected that selling one million Gold Cards could generate $5 trillion for the U.S. government.

The edge is not significant enough to recommend a trade.\n\nMARKET 2: YES  \nYour Probability: 95%  \nMarket Price: 87.0%  \nEdge: +8% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: +8% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Given the significant challenges and shortfall in sales for the Trump Gold Card program, the likelihood of selling zero cards is very high. However, the edge is slightly below the 10% threshold, but the strong reasoning supports a YES recommendation.\n\nMARKET 3: NO  \nYour Probability: 40%  \nMarket Price: 61.0%  \nEdge: -21% (Your prob - Market)  \nExpected Value: -21% \u00d7 potential payout  \nReasoning: Despite increased U.S. military pressure, historical resilience and political control by Maduro suggest a lower probability of him being out by March 31, 2026, than the market predicts.

The market price fairly reflects the uncertainty around this spread - no significant edge exists.\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 2: Will Trump sell 0 Gold Cards in 2025?**\n\nMARKET 2: NO\nYour Probability: 45%\nMarket Price: 87%\nEdge: -42%\nExpected Value: 42% \u00d7 ~7.7 = +3.2 units (betting NO)\nReasoning: The news explicitly states there have been sales - Lutnick claimed \"$5 billion raised in a day by selling 1000 gold cards\" in March 2025. Even if sales underperformed projections, selling ZERO cards is extremely unlikely given confirmed early sales. The 87% YES price appears to be a massive mispricing - this should resolve NO (meaning at least 1 card was sold).\n\n---\n\n**MARKET 3: Maduro out by March 31, 2026?**\n\nMARKET 3: NO\nYour Probability: 25%\nMarket Price: 61%\nEdge: -36%\nExpected Value: 36% \u00d7 ~1.6 = +0.58 units (betting NO)\nReasoning: Despite U.S. pressure, Maduro has survived multiple crises, sanctions, and coup attempts since 2019. Other prediction markets (Kalshi at 19%, Polymarket's \"leaves Venezuela\" at 31%) show much lower probabilities. Authoritarian leaders rarely exit on external timelines - 61% dramatically overestimates the likelihood of regime change in ~3.5 months.",

The market price of 46.7% for 76ers covering is approximately fair given these factors.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 2: NO_TRADE\nYour Probability: 82%\nMarket Price: 87.0%\nEdge: -5.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Moderate negative - insufficient edge for NO\nReasoning: The Trump Gold Card program has significantly underperformed sales targets despite initial claims. However, with the program already launched and operational, there's still time remaining in 2025 for some sales to occur. The 87% market probability of ZERO sales seems slightly too high, but not enough edge to trade.\n\n---\n\n## MARKET 3: YES\nYour Probability: 75%\nMarket Price: 61.0%\nEdge: +14.0% (Your prob - Market)\nExpected Value: Strong positive (+14% edge \u00d7 payout)\nReasoning: U.S. has dramatically intensified pressure with military actions including seizing Venezuelan oil tankers and increased Caribbean military presence. Combined with internal opposition momentum and international pressure, the probability of Maduro's departure by March 31, 2026 is significantly higher than the 61% market price.
