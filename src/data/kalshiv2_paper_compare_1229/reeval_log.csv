THE ""NEW INFORMATION"" CONFIRMS WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY, BUT PROFESSIONAL METEOROLOGICAL FORECASTS FOR TOMORROW ARE TYPICALLY 90%+ ACCURATE. OUR ORIGINAL 34% PROBABILITY WAS SPECULATIVE FOR A DISTANT DATE; WE SHOULD NOW CHECK ACTUAL FORECASTS AND EXIT THIS POSITION SINCE WE'RE BETTING YES AT $0.19 (IMPLYING 19% PROBABILITY) WHEN THE TRUE PROBABILITY CAN NOW BE DETERMINED WITH NEAR-CERTAINTY FROM WEATHER SERVICES.","No recent news found.

WITHOUT SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT DECEMBER 2025 CPI WILL MEET BOTH CONDITIONS (>0% MOM AND >2.7% YOY), AND GIVEN WE'RE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR ENTRY, THE RISK/REWARD NO LONGER FAVORS HOLDING THIS POSITION.","No recent news found.  It's impossible to definitively answer whether the CPI will be above 0% and the YoY CPI above 2.7% for December 2025 with certainty. Economic forecasting is inherently uncertain, especially that far into the future. Here's some relevant background:  *   **CPI and Inflation:** The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.
