THE ""NEW INFORMATION"" CONFIRMS WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY, BUT PROFESSIONAL METEOROLOGICAL FORECASTS FOR TOMORROW ARE TYPICALLY 90%+ ACCURATE. OUR ORIGINAL 34% PROBABILITY WAS SPECULATIVE FOR A DISTANT DATE; WE SHOULD NOW CHECK ACTUAL FORECASTS AND EXIT THIS POSITION SINCE WE'RE BETTING YES AT $0.19 (IMPLYING 19% PROBABILITY) WHEN THE TRUE PROBABILITY CAN NOW BE DETERMINED WITH NEAR-CERTAINTY FROM WEATHER SERVICES.","No recent news found.  Predicting the high temperature in Chicago on December 30, 2025, with certainty is impossible. Weather forecasts become increasingly unreliable beyond a 10-day window.  Here's some relevant background information that could affect the outcome:  *   **Historical Data:** Chicago's historical weather data for December 30th shows significant variability. Temperatures have ranged from well below freezing to above 40°F in past years. Analyzing historical trends can provide a gen"

WITH 13 DAYS TO RESOLUTION AND NO SUBSTANTIVE INFORMATION SUGGESTING THE MARKET IS MISPRICED, OUR 18.2% UNREALIZED LOSS INDICATES THE MARKET HAS MOVED AGAINST US FOR LIKELY VALID REASONS. WITHOUT SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT DECEMBER 2025 CPI WILL MEET BOTH CONDITIONS (>0% MOM AND >2.7% YOY), AND GIVEN WE'RE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR ENTRY, THE RISK/REWARD NO LONGER FAVORS HOLDING THIS POSITION.","No recent news found.  It's impossible to definitively answer whether the CPI will be above 0% and the YoY CPI above 2.7% for December 2025 with certainty. Economic forecasting is inherently uncertain, especially that far into the future. Here's some relevant background:  *   **CPI and Inflation:** The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. It's a key indicator of inflation. A CPI above 0"

THE ""NEW INFORMATION"" PROVIDED DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY ACTUAL WEATHER FORECAST FOR TOMORROW, WHICH IS CRITICAL INFORMATION WE NEED TO PROPERLY EVALUATE THIS POSITION. WITHOUT A CONCRETE FORECAST SHOWING <30°F IS LIKELY, AND GIVEN WE HAVE NO EDGE AT THE CURRENT $0.09 PRICE (MATCHING OUR 20% ESTIMATE), WE SHOULD EXIT AND WAIT FOR ACTUAL FORECAST DATA.","No recent news found.  Predicting the high temperature in Chicago on December 31, 2025, with certainty is impossible. Weather forecasts are notoriously unreliable beyond a week or two. However, we can consider historical data and climate trends.  *   **Historical Data:** Chicago's historical weather data shows a wide range of temperatures on December 31st. Averages can be calculated, but these don't guarantee future temperatures. You can find this data from sources like the National Weather Serv"
