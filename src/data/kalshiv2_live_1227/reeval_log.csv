THE COMBINATION OF NEGATIVE PRICE MOVEMENT, NO SUPPORTING CATALYSTS, AND OUR ENTRY ABOVE CURRENT FAIR VALUE (0.33 VS 0.27) SUGGESTS OUR EDGE HAS EVAPORATED AND WE SHOULD CUT LOSSES.","No recent news found (last 7 days) specifically addressing CPI and YoY CPI forecasts for December 2025. It is too far in the future for specific predictions to be widely discussed in current news cycles.  **Relevant Background & Factors Influencing CPI:**  *   **Inflation Targets:** The Federal Reserve (the Fed) targets an average inflation rate of 2% over the long run.
