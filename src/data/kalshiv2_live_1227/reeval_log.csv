OUR POSITION IS DOWN 20% AND THE MARKET HAS MOVED AGAINST US (FROM $0.15 TO $0.12), SUGGESTING OTHER PARTICIPANTS HAVE INFORMATION OR ANALYSIS WE LACK. WITH NO POSITIVE CATALYST, DETERIORATING PRICE ACTION, AND THE ORIGINAL 28% PROBABILITY ESTIMATE APPEARING OPTIMISTIC GIVEN THE MARKET'S CURRENT 12% PRICING, THE RISK/REWARD NO LONGER FAVORS HOLDING THIS LOSING POSITION.","No recent news found specifically addressing the hypothetical December 2025 CPI figure. It's impossible to find news articles from the last 7 days directly predicting a specific CPI number that far in the future. Economic forecasting doesn't work with that level of precision that far out.  However, here's some relevant background and factors that would influence that number:  *   **CPI Calculation:** The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban"

WITH 13 DAYS TO RESOLUTION BUT THE EVENT BEING DECEMBER 2025 CPI DATA (WHICH WON'T BE RELEASED UNTIL JANUARY 2026), THIS APPEARS TO BE A MARKET STRUCTURE ISSUE - WE'RE LIKELY IN THE WRONG CONTRACT OR THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT RESOLUTION TIMING. THE COMBINATION OF NEGATIVE PRICE MOVEMENT, NO SUPPORTING CATALYSTS, AND OUR ENTRY ABOVE CURRENT FAIR VALUE (0.33 VS 0.27) SUGGESTS OUR EDGE HAS EVAPORATED AND WE SHOULD CUT LOSSES.","No recent news found (last 7 days) specifically addressing CPI and YoY CPI forecasts for December 2025. It is too far in the future for specific predictions to be widely discussed in current news cycles.  **Relevant Background & Factors Influencing CPI:**  *   **Inflation Targets:** The Federal Reserve (the Fed) targets an average inflation rate of 2% over the long run. Their monetary policy decisions (interest rate adjustments, quantitative tightening) are the primary tools used to influence in"

THE CURRENT PRICE OF $0.06 SUGGESTS THE MARKET NOW ASSIGNS ~6% PROBABILITY TO THIS OUTCOME, SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW OUR ORIGINAL 31% ESTIMATE. WITHOUT CATALYSTS TO SUPPORT OUR POSITION AND WITH THE MARKET REPRICING DOWNWARD, OUR EDGE APPEARS TO HAVE ERODED, MAKING THIS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO CUT LOSSES BEFORE FURTHER DETERIORATION.","No recent news found.  It is impossible to definitively predict CPI and YoY CPI for December 2025. These figures will depend on numerous economic factors evolving over the next two years. However, here's some relevant background information that influences CPI:  *   **Inflation Trends:** Recent inflation trends and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy are crucial. If inflation remains persistent, the likelihood of CPI and YoY CPI exceeding the stated thresholds increases. Conversely, if the Fed"
